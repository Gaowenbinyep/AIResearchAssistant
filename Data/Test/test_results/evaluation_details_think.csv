Finally, MyRIO software is used to calibrate the sensors before each experiment to achieve a final readout normalized to body weight.  2.2.3 Human Subject Experiment Methodology  The human subject experiment was designed to demonstrate the potential benefit of the knee-ankle exoskeleton during multiple, common ADLs. These tasks were: sit to stand, stand to sit, treadmill walking, and stair climbing. The primary aim of the experiment was to show a reduction in effort of the muscles related to the joints assisted by Comex 1. We assessed activation levels of the following muscles: vastus medialis oblique (VMO), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus (SOL), which function as a knee extensor, knee flexor, dorsi-flexor, and plantar-flexor respectively. A single, male human subject (mass: 80 kg, height: 1.78 m) was enrolled for the study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas at Dallas and the University of Michigan.\n']","

自适应阻抗控制如何提升外骨骼系统在非结构化环境中的动态响应性能？
","['\namong the devices. Both MTx and BioStampRC detected significantly distinct gait charac- teristics between PwMS with different disability levels (p<0.01).  Conclusion  BioStampRC sensors accurately and precisely measure gait parameters in PwMS across diverse walking impairment levels and detected differences in gait characteristics by disabil- ity level in PwMS. This technology has the potential to provide granular monitoring of gait both inside and outside the clinic.  1. Introduction  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that affects an estimated 400,000 peo- ple in the USA, and has a worldwide prevalence of 2.5M [1]. MS is characterized by inflamma- tory demyelination and axonal damage in the central nervous system, which result in conduction delays and blockage of electrical potentials along neuronal pathways [2]. The MS pathology transitions into a neurodegenerative disease process associated with insufficient neurotrophic support resulting in irreversible axonal and neuronal loss [3]. This progressive disease commonly affects mobility (i.e. gait function) [4]. Gait impairment in persons with MS (PwMS) has been identified by altered spatio-temporal gait parameters such as slower gait speed, reduced cadence, shorter step length, prolonged stride time and increased double sup- port period [5, 6]. Therefore, accurate assessment of gait characteristics in PwMS is required to examine the severity and progression of gait impairment.  Gait assessment in PwMS has relied on analysis in gait laboratories, with specialized equip-  ment including expensive motion capture systems, pressure sensitive walkways, and force- plates [7]. Clinicians also utilize objective performance based measures (e.g. timed-25 foot walk (T25W)), 6 minute walk test (6MW) [8], and subjective functional ambulation tests (e.g. Performance-Oriented mobility assessment, Dynamic Gait Index)) [8, 9] to assess gait func- tion. However, all of these clinical assessments only provide a ‘snapshot’ of an individual’s walking ability that may not extrapolate to typical gait performance under normal daily conditions.\n']","

The experimenters located the following nine EMG elec- trode locations on the lower limbs of each subject: (1) right rectus femoris, (2) right gluteus maximus, (3) left rectus femoris, (4) left gluteus maximus, (5) left sartorius, (6) left medial hamstring, (7) left medial gastrocnemius, (8) left soleus, and (9) left tibialis anterior. The rectus femoris and gluteus maximus locations were control sites while the other six EMG locations were solely for the purpose of understanding changes in lower limb muscle activ- ity during the experiment. The experimenters placed reflective markers along the lower limb for inverse dynamics calculations based on the Cleveland Clinic convention [Heisenberg, (date unknown)]. These marker locations included the feet, shank, knee, thigh, hip, and pelvis. We fit subjects to the exoskeleton using adjustable shoulder, waist, and thigh straps.

Experimental Methods The purpose of experiments in this study was to quantify not the human reaction but the torque tracking performance of various hardware and control conditions, the relative performance of torque tracking under diﬀerent desired and passive stiﬀness conditions for the same subjects. In theoretical analysis, we conjected that the subject does not aﬀect the relative relationship between desired/passive stiﬀness and tracking performance, but only the absolute values of the optimal control gains, and optimal tracking errors with a maximum tolerable exoskeleton control bandwidth (torque tracking rate). If this conjecture, together with the resulting hypotheses, is validated by single-subject experiments, then there is no need to testmultiplesubjectsfortheproofoftherelativeperoformanceof diﬀerent desired and passive stiﬀness values, which is unaﬀected by the subjects.

These results are primarily applicable for pneumatic systems (or hydraulic systems) due to the dynam- ics of the system, but may have use in electromechanical systems. Further experiments on electromechanical systems would be necessary to verify these conclusions.  Numerous industry and research groups are designing exo- skeletons that include actuated hip joints (Arazpour et al., 2014; Farris et al., 2014; Giovacchini et al., 2014; Asbeck et al., 2015). The findings of this study are useful to help designers to properly time exoskeleton assistance to reduce the metabolic cost of walk- ing. This includes applications for military use, industrial grade exoskeletons, and medical exoskeletons for disabled or elderly individuals. Studies on the effects on biomechanics and metabolic cost of human subjects wearing exoskeletons are necessary to help progress the field (Ferris, 2009).

Similar results have been reported in conventional treadmill studies with or without the partial weight support (19, 20, 48, 49). In these studies, a physical therapist assisted the child with manual corrections and verbal instructions, which led to improvements in walking (48). Instead of a physical ther- apist assisting in walking straight, TPAD can provide a robotic en- vironment for the children to strengthen extensor muscles compared with ordinary walking. This device can potentially reduce the effort and labor of the physical therapists so that they can focus on higher-level management, dosage, and monitoring of the patients.  Walk test showed improvements. Six Minute Walk test is a self-paced, submaximal test that assesses functional capacity for walking over a prolonged distance (53, 54). It reflects exercise tolerance and endur- ance required for the performance of active daily living (54). Here, we asked children to walk within a submaximal environment, by aug- menting weight, for longer than 6 min. We think that the training effect of the present study is better estimated by the Six Minute Walk test that is more analogous to the task in the TPAD training, rather than BBS or TUG tests.\n']","

","['\nExperimental testing was done on a single day. Subjects stood in the exoskeleton for 3 min while we measured oxygen consump- tion and carbon dioxide production using a metabolic analysis system (Oxycon Mobile, CareFusion). The subjects walked at 1.0 m/s to simulate a medium to low walking speed on a split belt-instrumented treadmill (Bertec) to measure their ground reaction forces. The order of the two powered conditions was randomized such that five subjects performed the state machine controller first and five subjects performed the EMG controller first. During the first 5 min of walking, subjects acclimated to walking with an exoskeleton as the experimenter slowly increased the amount of power supplied to maximum levels. Subject specific tuning parameters were set during this phase. For EMG control, the subject tuning parameters were the gains and thresholds for each of the four control muscles. For state machine controller, only the maximum hip flexion angle, the neutral hip flexion angle (measured during standing), and the peak weight were used as subject specific parameters for the controller. After the initial 5-min adjustment period, subjects walked for 30 min in each of the powered conditions while we measured their metabolic expenditure rate. In between the two powered conditions, sub- jects walked for 10 min with the unpowered exoskeleton while we measured their metabolic expenditure rate to have a baseline for comparison. Movie demonstrations of both controllers are available in Video S1 in Supplementary Material.  At the end of the experiment, subjects were verbally asked the following series of questions, and their responses were recorded.

髋部肌群力量减弱与膝关节和髋关节OA进展之间存在怎样的关联？
","['\nWeak lower-limb musculature is a significant contributor to the risk of OA, especially at the knee, which represents over 80% of the total burden of the disease [Vos et al., 2012]. The medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint (TFJ) and patella-femoral joint (PFJ) form the three compartments of the knee (and three potential regions for OA). Several studies support the theory of quadriceps weakness being a significant contributing risk factor towards knee OA progression in all three compartments. In [Amin et al., 2009] , it was found that greater quadriceps muscle strength pre- vented cartilage loss at the PFJ. Additionally these patients presented with less knee pain compared to controls. A proposed theory is that the medial and lateral quadriceps are uneven in strength and cause misalignment of the PFJ [Amin et al., 2009], which can increase pain during loading. This correlation between quadriceps weakness and knee pain was also found for TFJ OA [O’Reilly et al., 1998]. It is known that the quadriceps act as a shock absorbing mechanism during the gait cycle [de Oliveira Silva et al., 2015]. Weak quadriceps can therefore lead to knee instability and greater loading at the articular surfaces, increasing the risk for TFJ OA progression. There is also growing evidence that hip musculature has influence on the progression of both knee and hip OA. Preliminary findings show decreased hip extension, external rotation and abduction weakness in patients with knee OA compared to healthy adults [Deasy et al., 2016]. A similar correlation between weakened hip muscles and hip OA progression has been found [Amaro et al., 2007]. Im- portantly, the compensatory mechanisms of unilateral hip OA can lead to contralateral hip OA [Amaro et al., 2007] as well as contralateral knee OA [Shakoor et al., 2003]. Therefore, modular orthoses that can provide assistive torques at the knee and hip joints during daily tasks can com- pensate for weakness in quadriceps and hip musculature and mitigate the symptoms of knee and possibly hip OA. Instead of assisting musculature, current knee OA orthoses unload the medial or lateral knee joint space through the mechanical structure of the brace. These knee orthoses have shown pain reduction and functional improvement [Pollo et al., 2002] but they do not address pain associated with the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) compartment–most likely because they do not re- duce patellofemoral loads caused by the action of the quadriceps\n']","
髋部肌群力量减弱与膝关节和髋关节OA进展之间存在相互关联，主要通过步态代偿、关节不对称负荷和代偿性关节损伤机制实现。髋部肌群无力可导致髋关节和膝关节负荷失衡，进而促进OA进展，尤其在膝关节的PFJ和TFJ区域。髋部与膝部在OA发病机制中存在协同作用，髋部肌群减弱可能引发对侧髋或膝关节OA，但其在膝关节OA中的独立作用尚需进一步研究。
","
髋部肌群力量减弱与膝关节和髋关节OA进展之间存在双向关联：一方面，髋部肌群无力可能通过导致步态不稳定、关节对齐异常和负荷分布失衡，间接促进膝关节OA在胫股关节（TFJ）和髌股关节（PFJ）的进展；另一方面，髋部肌群力量减弱本身也是髋关节OA进展的潜在风险因素，且可能通过代偿机制引发对侧膝关节OA。这些机制表明，髋部肌群在下肢OA的病理过程中具有重要影响。

在模拟典型时间试验中，外骨骼是否有助于参与者保持更好的深蹲姿势，其评估指标是什么？
","['\nThe study comprised two sessions: fatiguing and non-fatiguing. Fatigue is inevitable and causes deleterious symptoms of reduced performance and increased risk of injury [National Safety Council, 2018; Zhang et al., 2015; CCOHS, 2019]. Accordingly, performance on a time trial is one of the classical measures of fatigue [Enoka and Duchateau, 2016]. Session 1 tested the hy- pothesis that the exoskeleton improves fatigued LL performance (time trial of 10 fatigued LL reps) compared to no exoskeleton (bare), when squatting posture is enforced. Participants performed repeated squat LL until fatigue-induced failure (without power in the exoskeleton condition), im- mediately followed by 10 timed squat LL cycles (with power in the exoskeleton condition). Partici- pants were instructed to take the minimum required pause between repetitions in order to complete the next repetition with good squat posture, emulating a typical time trial while ensuring safe pos- ture. Although squatting posture was an experimental control, we performed an exploratory anal- ysis of peak thorax lean to see if the exoskeleton helped participants maintain a better squat form. Session 1 also gathered qualitative subjective feedback of exoskeleton effectiveness in post-fatigue multi-terrain LLC. At least one week later, session 2 tested the hypothesis that the exoskeleton reduces quadriceps effort during multi-terrain LLC in a non-fatigued state. A recent study simi- larly investigated back exoskeleton-induced improvements in worker performance with time trials of various activities [Luger et al., 2023], along with assessing muscular, postural, and perceptual benefits.  61\n']","

Gait Customization  P (f|D) ≈ P (fMAP  |D)e− 1  2  (f−f  MAP  )TK−1(f−f  MAP  ).  The principle of personalized gait customization is to adjust the functional of the state variables [r1,r2,r3,r4] to maximize the wearer’s comfort level. Therefore, the amplitude oscil- lators described previously can also be utilized in the con- struction of functional optimization problems. The challenge is that human comfort cannot be quantiﬁed, and the objec- tive function cannot be explicitly deﬁned. Conversely, humans do excel at comparing options and expressing a preference for one over the others [35], [36].

Similar to zero-order hold, a parallel thread was created to read vGRF continuously at ∼ 55 Hz, which gave the latest vGRF every 0.02 s and avoided slowing down the main control loop at 200 Hz. The sensor was calibrated using a predefined calibration procedure before each use to achieve a final readout normalized to body weight in the same manner as the vGRFs from the normative dataset used for the controller simulation.

    在考虑电机瞬态操作空间时，低占空比允许外骨骼电机在短时间内运行于高于连续转矩的瞬态区域，从而提高输出功率。由于焦耳热与电流平方成正比且电流与转矩相关，低占空比可避免热积累，使电机在可控热负荷下实现高瞬时功率输出。然而，需权衡高电压带来的高传动比、高阻抗及效率下降问题。因此，低占空比有助于提升外骨骼电机的瞬态性能，但需结合系统设计优化其应用。

Proposed subject-independent attention-based CNN-BiLSTM model  Conv1D and BiLSTM were used in the present model for data extraction due to their excellent performance in capturing time-series data features [25]. A recent study has developed a CNN-BiLSTM model that utilize the advantages of both CNN and BiLSTM to process surface EMG and IMU data [26]. As the BiLSTM lacks the ability of global information extraction [27], the attention mechanism was used in the proposed model to provide an ability to capture essential informa- tion [28]. In the present study, the long-term time-series kinematic data was collected by IMUs. Therefore, an attention-based CNN-BiLSTM hybrid model was proposed for the estimation of the lower-limb joint moments. The framework of the proposed model is illustrated in Fig. 2. The present model consisted of three blocks, namely the CNN network, BiLSTM network and attention mechanism.  Fig. 3.

自适应前馈模型如何提升执行系统的力跟踪性能？
","['\n. CAN Communication was selected to satisfy the 1 kHz control loop rate requirement for a simpler implementation compared to Ethercat. In the top layer, a dell precision T3500 computer is configured as the real time target machine that runs Matlab Simulink for the control implementation. A PCI interface card for CAN (CAN-AC PCI, Softing AG, Haar, Germany) is installed on this computer to acquire sensor signals and send desired current to servomotor driver through the microprocessor. All sensors and actuator signals including load cell, IMU, actuator encoders command motor current and measured motor current are all logged on the real time target machine at the control loop frequency. An Arduino Due is selected as the microprocessor in the middle layer. It acts as a signal hub between real time target machine and servomotor driver while protecting the system from undesired behavior of the actuator due to anomalous errors of signals from real time target machine. In the bottom layer, Gold Twitter (Elmo Motion Control Ltd, Israel) with 55V maximum supply voltage and 60 A peak current is selected as the current servomotor driver. It tracks the checked current command from the microprocessor to drive the actuator at the desired speed and stiffness. With this control system structure, it keeps the possibility to make this actuation modular to be a self-contained actuation system without an external real time target machine similar to the off-board system in [22]. IV. SYSTEM MODELING To achieve accurate force tracking on a moving object through a soft interface, we need a high bandwidth control system. Feedforward ideas are shown to lead an increase in the effective bandwidth of a close-loop control and an improvement on tracking performance in previous studies [35], [36]. In this section, we present accurate models of suit stiffness, thigh motion, and actuator transmission. These models are integrated into our control architecture as feed forward models that significantly improved the force tracking performance of our actuation system. The detailed implementation of each FFM is described in Section V. A.

","['\n∑  ai =  (6)  i us)  ∑  v =  aihi  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved extraordinary success in various IMU-based tasks [30]. The LSTM is an RNN with a structure called cell, and LSTM relies on three gates in the cell to choose useful information and discard unwanted information [31].  (7)  i  here, ωs denotes the weight matrix and bs denotes the bias matrix.  The aforementioned cell structure endows LSTM with higher accu- racy than RNN in processing medium and long-term dependencies in time series. However, the standard LSTM only considers the previous moment information, and omits the future information. Therefore, the standard LSTM is limited in dealing with complex tasks [32]. To over- come the drawbacks of the standard LSTM, the BiLSTM that consists of forward and backward LSTM networks was employed in the present  3.4. Baseline models  In order to compare the accuracy of different DL models, two most commonly used DL models, i.e., Conv1D and BiLSTM, were developed, and four recently published model architectures, i.e., ANN [10], Conv2D [9], TCN [16], and hybrid LSTM-ANN model [17], were reproduced.

软性可穿戴外骨骼系统（exosuit）如何通过辅助关节扭矩实现对人体肌肉工作的增强？
","['\n. Also, static misalignment of the biological and exoskeleton joints can result in dynamic misalignments of up to 10 cm during normal movement, causing pain and even injury to users [15]. One solution has been to include redundant, passive degrees of freedom to accommodate these misalignments [16]; however, this adds further weight to the system. It is partly for these reasons that these systems do not typically reduce the metabolic power required for locomotion. In order to address these issues there has recently been work on developing active soft orthotics [17, 18] that show great promise in reducing the impedance experienced by the wearer and allowing more natural movement. As an alternative to rigid exoskeletons, we present the design and evaluation of a soft wearable device, we call an “exosuit” (Fig. 1). This device was designed to augment the normal muscle work of healthy individuals by applying assistive torques at the wearer’s joints with the goal of reducing the metabolic cost of transport of the wearer.

","['\nmotion in individuals with paraplegia, a number of researchers have investigated the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) to artiﬁcially elicit and control leg muscle contraction, thereby utilizing the musculature and metabolic power supply of the paraplegic subject to generate legged locomotion. Some of the research efforts in this regard include [3]–[13]. In ad- dition to providing power for locomotion, FES-aided gait has also been shown to provide a number of associated physiolog- ical beneﬁts, some of which include increased muscle strength, increased bone density, decreased spasticity, and improved car- diovascular health [14]–[20]. Despite this, FES-based systems entail a number of challenges; most notably, muscles are difﬁ- cult to control, particularly in the absence of adequate sensory information, and muscle torque output tends to fatigue rapidly, as a byproduct of the synchronous activation and preferential recruitment of fast-twitch muscle ﬁbers associated with FES.

B. Actuator Design and Characterization Actuators used for this study were constructed from latex tubing, expandable mesh, pinch clamps, and barbed fittings; all available commercially as previously described in [17]. While, commercial McKibbon actuators are available for purchase, custom actuators were made to minimize weight for the size and force requirements based on the biological specifications shown in Table I. As compressed air is supplied to the actuators, they expand radially, shortening in length and thereby providing actuation. Force can thus be modified by changing input pressure and the stroke length is determined based on the actuator length and properties. An actuator with an active length (excluding end hardware such as fittings and steel loops) of 200 mm was prototyped and force versus displacement data were recorded on an Instron 5544 load frame system for 1 to 5 bar (14.7 to 73.5 psi) input pressures (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Force versus displacement curves for a 200 mm long custom made McKibben actuator. Negative displacement indicates shortening. As shown, an actuator will generate a peak force when engaged at its rest length, from there, its force producing capabilities decrease with contraction. Increasing supply pressure increases the actuators force output and its amount of maximum contraction. For this prototype, 4 bar (58.8 psi) was chosen as an operating pressure to provide substantial actuating force, yet provide an additional safety measure, providing forces 38% lower than those at the maximum pressure of 5 bar (230 N vs 370 N). Air flow to the actuators was controlled by inline solenoid valves (Norgren, 2 position, 5/2 valve model E12), and air was supplied from the compressor to the system with 3/8 inch OD (1/4 ID) tubing, and distributed from the valves to the individual actuators with individual 1/4 inch OD (1/8 ID) tubes.

Therefore, lighter-weight hardware and autonomous systems were developed and tested in goal-driven experiments, with single-joint systems tested to explore underlying biological mechanisms. These technological advances ultimately enabled exoskeletons to meet the envisioned objectives of reducing the metabolic cost during loaded or unloaded locomotion for military, industrial and recreational applications.  Alongside the development of exoskeletons to enhance the performance of load carriage, devices (in particular, the Lokomat17, Gait Trainer18, lower extremity powered exoskeleton (LOPES)19, active leg exoskeleton (ALEX)20,21 and Rutgers Ankle22) were designed to mechanize physical therapy for individuals re-learning to walk fol- lowing spinal-cord injury (SCI) or stroke. Common clinical practice calls for physical therapists to manually move the feet and legs of non-ambulatory patients through the motions of walking to facili- tate re-learning of movement patterns for functional improvement23. Robotic devices were developed to offload this burden from physical therapists and to improve patient outcomes by delivering precise interventions and training at optimal intensities, unconstrained by the limits of manual assistance.

Although these knee forces appear inordinate, very few individuals other than compet- itive powerlifters are capable or willing to squat with a 382.5-kg external load.  Knee joint biomechanical models and anthropometric data used to estimate knee forces in Nisell and Ekholm (43) were based on 10 subjects from their previous studies (41,44), with a mean height of 180 cm and a mean body mass of 75 kg. This is one limitation in the study by Nisell and Ekholm (43), because their three subjects had a mean body mass 20 kg more than and a mean height 7 cm less (Table 1) than the 10 subjects used in their biomechanical models. Another limitation in their study was that the effect of co-contraction of the hamstring musculature was not considered. Because the calculated knee torque was the resultant torque (i.e., sum of all flexor and extensor torques), hamstring force, which generates a knee flexor torque, would cause greater quadriceps force and extensor torque. Consequently, all calculated knee forces in this study would be underestimated, because these forces are functions of quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon forces. Because the quadriceps tendon thickness is significantly greater than the patellar tendon thickness, it should be able to withstand a higher load before rupture. However, high magnitudes of compressive force and stress (force/area) between the fem- oral intercondylar notch and the quadriceps tendon may increase the injury potential of the quadriceps tendon. Tendofemoral compressive force between the quadriceps tendon and the femoral intercondylar notch began high at 6000 N at approximately 130° knee flexion, quickly de- creased to approximately 1750 N at 90° knee flexion and decreased to approximately 0 N at 60° knee flexion. As- suming a 3.4-cm2 tendofemoral contact area when the knee is flexed approximately 130° (24), tendofemoral compres- sive stress would be 17.6 MPa (6000 Nz0.00034 m-2). This large stress applied repetitively over time may cause degen- erative changes in the tendofemoral complex. Hence, per- forming the squat at knee flexion angles less than 90° will minimize tendofemoral stress and minimize injury potential to the tendofemoral complex.\n']","

We wished the front panel to be user friendly to the clinician who will ideally leverage the intuitive customizability of the controller to provide the appropriate assistance levels for each category of task or task phase to the patient based on their unique deficits. Four customization options were provided: as can be seen in Fig. 6.2, i.e., the ability to modulate the assistance for - 1) aiding in upward propulsion in ascent tasks, aiding bracing (energy absorption) in descent tasks, 3) aiding the strength of upward propulsion for sit-stand (or more generally closed chain squatting) tasks, and 4) leg clearance in general swing.

The GUI also provides a secondary feedback panel which receives data from the bilateral exoskeleton modules and displays them as live bar graphs.

At the same time, the user adapts his muscle activation patterns to exploit the available torques in a convenient way. If the assistance is effective, the motor adaptation process will result in lower muscle forces and thereby a less fatiguing walk for the user. A thorough understanding of the human adaptation process is therefore fundamental for designing an effective assistive device for walking [20].  Recent studies exploiting proportional EMG control and gait event detection have showed that when an assistive torque is provided, humans modulate their muscle activation in order to maintain the total torque profile, i.e., the sum of human muscular torque and assistive torque, unaltered along the gait cycle [21],[22]. As a consequence, the muscle torque decreases and the metabolic effort is reduced [23]\n']","

自适应阻抗控制如何提升外骨骼系统的人机协同性能？
","['\nData availability De-identiﬁed data relating to this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.  Results All 50 participants completed gait training and assessment (Pre/Mid/Post: n = 25 for FTST and SMA; Fol: n = 19 for FTST, n = 17 for SMA), with no adverse events in either intervention group. Stepping activity data were available for 24participantsineachgroup,andTMSdatawereavailablefor 15 participants in each group (ﬁgure 1).  Clinical assessments: comparison between time points One SMA participant was excluded from the 5XSST measure for having an outlying Pre score (121.5 seconds) compared with other time points (Mid: 29.7 seconds; Post: 41.6 sec- onds; Fol: 30.1 seconds). No reason was noted for the score. However, including the participant unfairly skews the average percentage changes for this outcome, so the SMA group appears to improve considerably in 5XSST. It is unlikely that such a drastic improvement at all other time-points could be attributed to the intervention at the participant’s stage of chronicity (5.1 years).  Figure 3 illustrates the progression of clinical outcome scores at Pre, Mid, Post, and Fol for the FTST and SMA groups. Table 2 reports the average percentage change in scores from Pre at Mid, Post, and Fol for each intervention group.  There was a main eﬀect of time on all outcome measures except pain rating and depression. There was also a main ef- fect of months since stroke on fastest walking speed (p = 0.023) and balance (p = 0.032). There was a main eﬀect of stroke subtype on balance (p = 0.002). Post hoc analyses revealed that both groups changed from Pre in walking speed, endurance, balance, and LE-FM at all other time points (p < 0.05). The primary outcome measure, self-selected walking speed, increased for the SMA group at Mid (0.14 ± 0.13 m/s, p < 0.001), Post (0.24 ± 0.14 m/s, p < 0.001), and Fol (0.22 ± 0.17 m/s, p < 0.001).

Both groups had signiﬁcantly greater changes in walking endurance than MDC and MCID at Post and Fol, indicating that these improvements persist even 3 months after training.

本文提出的基于连续刚度模型的扭矩控制器如何实现不依赖步态相位估计的连续扭矩控制？
","['\nD. Conclusion and Future Work  In this work, a continuous-phase stiffness model and the corresponding stiffness-based continuous torque controller are proposed and evaluated on a portable knee exoskeleton with eight able-bodied subjects during treadmill walking. This stiff- nessmodelcanachievealargeandsufﬁcientstiffnessbandwidth (16 Hz) to cover the normal human walking frequency range, and the controller achieves a small torque tracking error (0.23 N·m) under different stiffness. Our continuous torque controller requires no gait phase estimation and can adapt to varying speeds and generate a continuous torque proﬁle. Reducing the muscle activity of able-bodied subjects for level-ground walk- ing using a portable knee exoskeleton has traditionally been considered a difﬁcult task [65]. However, by leveraging our lightweight portable knee exoskeleton and our proposed contin- uous stiffness-based torque controller, our neuromuscular walk- ing experiments demonstrate that both the rms and maximum EMGofalleightmusclesdecreased(remarkableforthreeexten- sors and two ﬂexors) in the powered condition relative to the un- powered condition and two out of eight lower extremity muscles have a signiﬁcant reduction in muscle activation in the powered condition relative to the baseline (no-exoskeleton) condition. ComparedwiththeresultofthebaselineconditioninTableVIII,  the results showed that the powered exoskeleton could reduce the maximum EMG of knee extensors (VM, VL, and RF), knee ﬂexors(BFandSEM),andanklemuscle(TA)andreducetherms of knee extensor (RF), knee ﬂexors (BF and SEM), and ankle muscle (TA). But the rms and maximum EMG of the ankle plan- tarﬂexors(MGandLG)wereincreasedby3.55%and2.18%,re- spectively.Therefore,itcanbeconcludedthatthekneeexoskele- ton can reduce the EMG signal of the knee ﬂexor and extensor muscles. In contrast, the weight of the exoskeleton might cause a slight increase in the EMG signal of the ankle plantar ﬂexors, and it cannot be mitigated by knee joint torque assistance.\n']","

In this paper, the authors combine the use of an externally powered lower limb exoskeleton with FES, in order to form a powered hybrid FES system. The intent of the system is to combine the power and movement control advantages of the powered lower limb exoskeleton with the physiological bene- ﬁts provided by FES. The proposed system is of the same gen- eral class of systems as the hybrid FES systems previously cited (i.e., [21]–[28]), but incorporates two sources of motive power (metabolic and robotic), and therefore offers additional control authority with which to supplement the FES. Such an approach requires a control methodology that can effectively combine these dissimilar sources of motive power, which is the topic of this paper.  Some researchers have recently explored the notion of com- bining FES with powered exoskeleton systems for individuals with paraplegia, as described in [41] and [42]. In [41], the au- thors describe a feasibility study combining quadriceps stimu- lation with a lower limb exoskeleton that includes hip and knee joint actuation. In that work, the authors manually tune a quadri- ceps stimulation pulse on a single healthy subject, and show that once appropriately tuned, the quadriceps stimulation decreased the torque required from the knee actuator to achieve similar joint angle tracking. In [42], the authors also describe a control method for combining FES with a powered knee joint, and im- plemented this method on ﬁve healthy subjects. In that work, the knee joint motor is controlled by a variable-stiffness con- troller, with the stiffness controlled as a function of the interac- tion torque between the user and the exoskeleton. Concurrently, the knee extensor muscle stimulation is controlledby a PID con- troller, and knee ﬂexor muscle stimulation is controlled by an iterative learning controller.\n']","

文中提出的软体外骨骼设备如何结合刚性与柔性设计的优势以提升穿戴舒适性与关节对齐特性？
","['\nTo address the above issues, there has recently been work on developing active soft orthotics. A team at Harvard University has developed a soft exosuit to assist the wearer’s natural gait performance in the military and medical ﬁelds [11]–[13]. Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons with rigid support frames, this exosuit uses soft materials, such as textiles and elastomers, so that it can be worn like clothing. However, until now this soft wearable device has presented its own inherent limitations, such as the absence of weight-support functionality. As shown in Fig.1(b), the device pulls the extremity of a human body by the wire directly without load-support frames to assist the joint torque. Considering the importance of the weight- support function for the elderly who have arthritis pain, the effectiveness of the device in assisting the elderly’s gait has not yet been proved.  To solve these limitations of conventional rigid and soft wearable devices, we proposed a novel wearable walking assis- tance device named Samsung walking-assist device for lower extremities (abbreviated as “S-Assist L-type”) for personal use. Its biomechanical design takes the best of the above two approaches, conjugating a ﬂexible load-support structure for increased wearability and comfort, with a multi-joint kinematics for compliance and self-alignment with anatomical joints.  We developed in this work the ﬁrst prototype of a novel, tightly ﬁtting, more comfortable walking assist device for per- sonal use. It was designed to support the geriatric population with moderate impairment to walk or stand. Our aim is to promote active daily living for the elderly and the inﬁrm, who require lower-body physical support without adverse social consequences. The S-Assist can transmit a maximum of 20Nm of torque to the hip and knee joints independently. As shown in Table II, considering the added mass of the device, it is approx- imately 11.4%–26% of the torque required for the wearer’s hip and knee joints during walking or single-leg standing based on a 70-kg bodyweight. Although these maximum assist torques  (a)  (b)  Fig. 2.

The state vectors qj, pj ∈ Rm×1 comprise samples over time for the given task j with the number of time samples m.  The objective function comprises four parts, where the ﬁrst part corresponds to the least squares error of the exoskeleton control inputsU ∈ R2m×1 and the normalized able-bodied hu- man torquesYj ∈ R2m×1 for the ankle and knee joints with the weighting matrix Wj(U,Yj). The weighting matrix Wj(U,Yj) depends on the exoskeleton and human inputs (U,Yj) and adjusts the weights according to sign(U(i) ·Yj(i)), where i ∈ {1,...,2m} represents the sample index. We enlarge the weights when U(i) and Yj(i) have opposite signs to empha- size the importance of assisting rather than resisting human torques.

This helps regulate the exoskeleton torques u at endpoints of the stance phase. This also minimizes the dependence on vGRF for real-time imple- mentation to avoid aggressive torques when the custom force sensor in [24] returns inconsistent measurements of vGRF compared to the force plates in the dataset [33].\n']","

Both our controllers provided appropriate knee ex- tension and plantar-ﬂexion assistance torques that resulted in noticeable reductions in VMO (s1) and SOL (s2) activity in the stance phase. Since the knee goes through a minimal range of motion during stance in level walking, our prior controller that utilized only potential energy shaping [24] was not ade- quate to provide assistance during this phase. With the PHI and WOP controllers developed in the present study, adequate knee extension assistance torques are provided to assist with impact absorption in early stance.  The TA activations for both PHI and WOP were higher than bare for all walking tasks. This is similar to the results in [41], where the TA during the swing phase had increased activity with decreasing gravity. One explanation is that we are not providing adequate torques to support the weight of the sensorized exoskeleton foot plate. It is also possible that the provided plantar-ﬂexion torques are excessive, necessitating the TA activation to compensate. Future work will model the passive dynamics of the muscle-tendon unit for all joints. This is especially important for the ankle, i.e., the Achilles tendon is known to provide signiﬁcant storage and release of energy, much like a spring.  The purpose of BF during swing is to lift the foot by ﬂexing the knee, aiding in leg clearance.

","['\n61  For all metrics, we used linear mixed models (LMMs) with condition (bare, exo) and gender (male, female) being fixed effects and participant being treated as a random effect. For post- fatigue performance and posture metrics, we included additional effects of order (for the bare vs. exo condition) and pre-fatigue workload (number of pre-fatigue LL repetitions required to reach fatigue). Although our power analysis originally called for ten participants, we concluded our study early after completing eight participants due to 1) the unavoidable risk and discomfort of the fatiguing protocol, and 2) the strong trends observed in our primary metric. The p-values of all metrics tested were therefore corrected as per the early stoppage criteria (Pocock boundary) by scaling by a factor of 1.7. We also corrected for multiple testing (six tasks) for the quadriceps effort metric using the Holm Bonferroni method. Gender, order, and workload were found to be non-significant factors in all statistical tests reported below.  5.3.1 Performance and postural benefits in post-fatigue lifting-lowering  The results confirmed our hypothesis that the knee exoskeleton improves post-fatigue LL com- pletion time. Compared to bare, the bilateral knee exoskeleton induced a significant (p<0.001) 33% reduction, 95% CI [21%, 43%], in the time to complete 10 LL repetitions post-fatigue, corre- sponding to raw un-adjusted averages of 50 seconds (bare) and 35 seconds (exo). Fig. 5.2 shows the completion time distributions, and Fig. 5.3 shows the ensemble averaged durations for 10 LL repe- titions before and after fatigue was declared. We also found that the pre-fatigue workload (number of pre-fatigue LL repetitions performed in exo condition as a percentage of bare condition) was uncorrelated (r = −0.11) with the post-fatigue completion time (exo condition as a percentage of bare condition, Fig. 5.4).

Phase space  As previously mentioned, the method presented here is based on a phase variable (PV) representation, which requires that the variable input of interest be represented in a phase space (i.e., a signal as a function of its derivative). The methodology presented here further requires that the input variable form a simple closed curve in the phase space.

This feature allows free movement of the limbs with no re- strictions on any degree of freedom (DOF) and reduces the therapist’s effort to align the joint axes of the device with the human limbs or to adjust the size of the rigid links to the child’s body. Because gait is a se- quential coordination of limbs in three dimensions, restriction of spe- cific DOFs can alter the entire gait pattern. For instance, the restriction of the leg in the sagittal plane, such as what Lokomat provides, can cause issues of lateral balance after the intervention, because the gait pattern is practiced within an artificial environment where the hip abduction/adduction muscles are not actively involved in the motor con- trol (32). (iii) TPAD imposes an overall external force during movement and allows the users to coordinate and control the limb DOF. Because CP is caused by impaired central nervous system (4), the type and level of lesion are quite different among individual children (33). Instead of providing assistance to each joint with a predefined phase-dependent torque or displacement, TPAD promotes variability among joints and provides flexibility to the users in learning, as suggested by theories of human motor learning (34).  Six children diagnosed with CP and exhibiting crouch gait under- went 15 training sessions of 16 min each, over a duration of 6 weeks. We hypothesized that, as the study participants raise their center of mass against the applied downward force from TPAD during walk- ing, they will improve control of their ankle plantar flexor muscles, especially the soleus, and improve their crouched posture. The mus- cle strength and coordination were investigated using electromyog- raphy (EMG) data from the first and after last sessions of training.

Second, this framework enables a single feedback controller to closely ﬁt normalized able-bodied human joint torques for all primary ADLs: level-ground walking, walking at variable inclines/declines, stair ascent/descent with vari- able step heights, and stand-to-sit. While recent work in [30] proposed a deep learning approach to estimating subject- independent hip joint torques for walking on level ground, ramps, and stairs, no prior work has estimated more compli- cated knee and ankle torque proﬁles for all primary ADLs (without switching or adaptation between tasks). Third, we assess the muscular effort of multiple able-bodied human subjects with an experimental implementation of this task- invariant control method on a (knee-ankle) exoskeleton to assist the primary ADLs.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II re- views the concepts of the port-controlled Hamiltonian systems and the corresponding matching conditions for the human- exoskeleton dynamics with contact constraints. In Section III, we design the desired closed-loop Hamiltonian system and the corresponding control law by incorporating the global orientation variable and GRF. We highlight passivity and sta- bility properties based on common human control policies. Section IV presents training and validation results for the optimized controller over a dataset of the primary ADLs. Section V then presents the hardware implementation and able-bodied human subject experiments.

低占空比对外骨骼电机性能的影响主要体现在其在连续电流限制下可提升输出扭矩，从而增强其在动态负载下的运行能力。然而，在瞬态操作中，低占空比可能限制电机的高响应能力，导致动态响应降低。因此，低占空比有助于提升连续运行的扭矩输出，但在瞬态条件下可能影响整体性能表现。
","
    在考虑电机瞬态操作空间时，低占空比使外骨骼电机能够在高于连续运行极限的转矩下短暂运行（即瞬态操作空间），从而满足短时高功率需求。这种操作模式通过利用已知的低占空比特性，在不持续超过热限制的前提下提升电机性能。文献未提及潜在的热累积或效率下降问题，但强调了该策略在提升瞬时功率输出方面的有效性。

自适应振荡器序列如何实现下肢外骨骼的基本步态学习与重建？
","['\nother control techniques, such as PID and impedance control, as discussed earlier [20], [21].  However, neural systems are complex and challenging to ac- curately simulate, which poses practical challenges. Commonly used models for CPGs can be categorized into bio-inspired half- center oscillator (HCO) models and abstract oscillator-based CPGs [22], [23]. HCO models consist of interconnected neural networks inspired by biology. Achieving optimal rhythmic pat- terns necessitates simulation, testing, and empirical parameter adjustments [24], [25], [26]. Consequently, exoskeletons may not be well equipped to handle unforeseen circumstances and unexpectedalterations.Moreover,HCOnetworksareinherently reactive and rely on continuous feedback to maintain stabil- ity [27]. On the other hand, CPGs of the abstract oscillator type have the capability to adjust parameters online [28], [29]. Their combination with dynamic movement primitives [30] appears to be a suitable strategy for lower limb exoskeletons. However, this approach requires a lengthy adaptation process and can only learn the gait patterns of pilots [31], [32], lacking true adaptability for the broader exoskeleton population. Hence, there is a clear need for targeted enhancements in existing CPG technology to better control exoskeletons.  The study concerns a bench-style lower limb exoskeleton as theapplicationplatform,whichiscomprisedofanexoskeleton,a treadmill,andaweightreductionbench.Thegaitgenerationsys- tem is utilized to synchronize the exoskeleton’s speed with that of the treadmill. Furthermore, preference learning algorithms are integrated for personalized gait customization.  The main contributions of this article are as follows. 1) A gait-generation strategy for lower limb exoskeleton  based on CPG is proposed.  2) An oscillator sequence with the ability to learn basic gait is proposed, and targeted modiﬁcations for gait recon- struction are made.  3) Variational controller coupling with oscillator sequences is proposed, achieving speed synchronization between exoskeletons and treadmills, as well as personalized gait customization.\n']","

","['\nadjusts the impedance or position of the prosthetic joints based on gait phase and the users locomotor task (e.g. level walking, stair ascent and descent). The autonomous control cannot predict the user’s intent in terms of locomotor tasks and therefore cannot adapt to walking terrains. One solution is to build a neural-machine interface that predict the users intended locomotor task for prosthesis operation. Several groups have developed neural-machine interfaces (NMIs) for artiﬁcial legs to decipher neuromuscular signals (i.e. electromyographic (EMG) signals) and identify the user’s intended locomotor tasks and transitions [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. These approaches have been demonstrated to enable lower limb amputees to drive their prosthesis intuitively and switch locomotor tasks seamlessly. It has to been shown that active prostheses have the potential offer more comfort and less energy waste to the amputee compared to passive ones, [12], [13], [14]. The development of intelligent prosthetic devices has been done for a while as reported by [15]. Early investigations such as [12], [16], [17], implemented control and signal processing techniques to electromechanical systems in order to provide reliable systems that bring more comfort to the amputee. This type of research is still ongoing. Contemporary approaches make use of learning algorithms applied on exoskeletons and robotic limbs [18] with neural interfaces to the user for enhanced control, [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24] and response to human stimuli and intent, the so-called volitional control. For example, in order to give context awareness to the volitional control system for a prosthetic leg, [25] combined an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a laser distance the terrain type and slope in front meter to reconstruct of the user [25]. Lately, context awareness strategies have gained an extra resource, the use of computer vision (CV). For example, deep learning techniques have been applied to prosthetic arms in order to enhance the grasp perception, independently of object forms or size [26]. However, the requirements and constraints to upper limbs prosthetics are very different than the ones to lower limbs, speciﬁcally in terms of response time and robustness.

The target output torque is determined as a function of the gait cycle, user weight, and walking speed. The gait cycle is estimated using our new algorithm called the particularly shaped adaptive oscillator [17], which is a modification of previous adaptive frequency oscillators in [14–16]. A reference torque pattern for assistance is predefined as a function of the gait cycle, speed, and slope. We identified a specific torque pattern for effective assistance after intensive trials. This pattern is illustrated in Fig. 10. IV. RESULTS As shown in Fig. 11, the maximum thickness is selected among values from the surfaces of the user to the maximum height of the device with a motion analysis system. The results are listed in Table II. The maximum thickness is less than 29 mm at the joint and 22 mm at the frame.

本文中所采用的背驱式扭矩控制执行器在设计上如何兼顾低反向驱动扭矩与高输出扭矩能力？
","['\n11  To address these gaps, our prior work [Lv and Gregg, 2018; Lv et al., 2018] developed a task-invariant exoskeleton control strategy that assists the user’s voluntary movements with ener- getic control objectives rather than kinematic objectives. This work implemented a control tech- nique called potential energy shaping in a unilateral knee-ankle exoskeleton (Comex 1) to reduce the perceived gravity of the user. The control strategy leverages the exoskeleton’s backdrivable, torque-controlled actuators, which comprise a high-torque motor with a low-ratio transmission (24:1). This design minimizes the backdrive torques (around 3 Nm) while being capable of out- put torques up to 60 Nm [Zhu et al., 2017], which is sufficient for rehabilitation of the primary ADLs post-stroke [Hidler et al., 2007; Ng and Hui-Chan, 2012]. However, the potential energy shaping approach in [Lv and Gregg, 2018; Lv et al., 2018] relies on a model that assumes the stance leg is fully loaded with the weight of the user, resulting in excessive plantar-flexor torques as weight transfers from the assisted leg to the contralateral leg during double support. This exces- sive plantar-flexion can aggravate the foot-drop problem later in swing, during both walking and stair climbing. For sit to stand, the controller provides double the required torque, as body weight should be equally shared between the two legs. During sitting, excessive ankle and knee torques are applied as most of the weight is supported by the seat. These limitations must be overcome before this control approach can serve patient populations.\n']","

Therefore, the objectives of this work were to (1) collect bilateral lower limb kinematic and myoelectric signals hypothetically accessible for exoskeleton control from an able-bodied population freely performing various locomotor activities, and (2) apply intent recognition for offline prediction to demonstrate the baseline viability of translating this type of control strategy from active LL prostheses to exoskeletons.

基于机器人辅助训练的方法在中风患者肩肘运动康复中的作用机制是什么？
","['\nthis practice is also becoming more widespread in Japan(2). Extensive research has been done on compensating for this lack of muscular strength using robotic technology, and on power assist technologies that would further boost muscular strength. Devices have also been developed that measure the amount of force the individual wishes to generate using electromyographs and force sensors, and boost their strength with power assist(3).  Meanwhile, some reports have indicated that the level of stress associated with a particular amount of exercise can be reduced simply by altering the way in which the individual moves(4)-(7). Rather than exerting force constantly from the beginning to the end of a movement, concentrating force at the appropriate time and then relying on inertia reduces heart rate, blood pressure, energy consumption(4)-(7).  In the case of walking also, research has commenced on a two-axis walk, which effectively uses changes in the center of gravity(7). In this mode of walking, virtual axes passing through the foot making contact with the ground, the knee, the hip joint, and the shoulder blade, move forward alternately on the left and right like a pair of stilts. The center of gravity moves forward without the upper and lower bodies twisting. This two-axis walk has  Fundamental Technology Research Center  ** Automobile R&D Center  – 57 –  Honda R&D Technical Review  October 2009  recently been used by Japanese athletes who have been said to be at a disadvantage in terms of physique and muscular strength. This technique has enabled them to supplement their muscular strength with gravity and inertia, and to achieve good results in world championships(8).  Robots are also being used while patients who have been paralyzed by strokes are being retrained in how to move their shoulders and elbows, in this case not to increase muscular strength but to teach patients the correct movements(9). The robot assists patients in moving their shoulders and elbows in the correct trajectory to enable them to grasp objects, generating a load if they move outside the appropriate trajectory. In this type of training process, results achieved using a robot are indicated as being superior to those achieved by normal training(9).\n']","

自适应优化算法如何提升基于IMU的关节角度估计精度？

IMUs are lightweight, inexpensive and easy to integrate into robotic systems, but also particularly sensitive to their physical alignment with biological joints (a challenge that rigid devices do not face). Furthermore, ori- entation measurements from IMUs suffer from inherent inaccuracies owing to bias (a constant offset compared to the true IMU orientation) and drift (a history-dependent change in orientation), which render measurements unusable within minutes if left uncorrected. Therefore, ensuring consistent alignment without first making precise measure- ments is difficult, hence IMU-based joint angles can be highly variable depending on placement. Importantly, asking wearers to take precise measurements each time they put on an exoskeleton hinders com- mercial applications, for which usability is crucial. Misalignments can be corrected by optimization algorithms that automatically estimate the location of the IMU relative to a biological joint, greatly improving joint-angle estimation accuracy194–197. Integrating these algorithms with wearable devices may enable the development of controllers that leverage joint-angle estimates for targeted assistance without requiring rigid joints. Such motion sensing could also be a valuable tool in the evaluation of a wearer’s kinematic performance outside of laboratory settings and could allow for the assessment of interventions at home or in the community. Furthermore, small IMUs worn during walking could inform an algorithm that determines the primary joint (or joints) at which a person experiences a gait deficit, along with the severity of that deficit. A clinician could then recommend a device appropriate for this specific deficit.\n']","

文中提出的三层助力控制器分别解决了哪些关键问题？
","['\nFor the purpose of the experiment, the controller has been implemented on a modified version of the ALEX II gait trainer (Fig. 1) [47] and experimentally tested on ten healthy subjects. Muscle activation and joint kinematics were recorded while subjects walked on a treadmill at a constant speed in three different conditions: free walking (i.e., no exoskeleton worn by the user), zero torque (i.e., exoskeleton working in transparent mode) and assisted (i.e., exoskeleton providing additional torque). Experimental results show that the controller successfully assisted the user as evidenced by a marked decrease of muscle activations, measured through electromyography, compared to free walking. Despite providing assistance only to the hip joint, both hip and ankle muscles significantly reduced their activation, demonstrating a clear tradeoff between these two joints in propelling gait.  Preliminary results have been reported in a conference [48].  II. METHODS  This section provides details of the assistive controller and its implementation on ALEX II gait trainer. Then, this section describes the experiment protocol and data analysis.  A. The Assistive Controller  In this paper, we explore this hypothesis by designing and testing a novel assistive controller that provides additional torque at the hip joint only, while allowing users to control their own kinematics.  The proposed assistive controller (Fig. 2(a)) is composed of three stages that address the following issues: (1) on-line estimate of the current phase of the gait cycle, (2) planning of the assistive torque, and (3) effective transfer of the desired assistive torque to the user’s leg.  Assistive controllers usually define the additional torque provided by the exoskeleton based on an estimate of the user’s joint torque [34],[35]. This approach allows having assistive torques that are coherent in direction and amplitude with the mechanical action of muscles. Following this approach, assistive torque profiles have been estimated through electromyography [36]-[38], solving the inverse- dynamic problem [39], or by applying algorithms based on inertia reduction [40], gait segmentation [41] and position- based force fields [42].\n']","

The squat primarily strengthens hip, thigh, and back musculature, which are very important muscles in running, is commonly believed among athletes and coaches that the squat enhances athletic performance and minimizes injury potential. Because the dynamic squat has been classified as a closed kinetic chain exercise (17,58,65,71), it is also appropriate and commonly used in knee rehabilitation settings. Several studies have demonstrated the favorable use of the squat exercise during knee rehabilitation (21,32,39,47,52,58,71), such as after cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery. Consequently, an understanding of knee biomechanics during the squat is helpful to therapists, trainers, sports medicine physicians,  jumping, and lifting.

研究中采用了哪些定量和定性评估方法来全面分析外骨骼辅助对不同病理特征患者的运动功能改善效果？
","['\nWe investigated two highly impaired cases of MS and PPS. The manual muscle test (MMT) and clinician assessment of the PPS patient revealed that he had a highly impaired (atrophied) right  75  leg from the hip down, and quadriceps weakness in his left side. Accordingly, discussion with the patient and on-site clinician highlighted the need to assist knee extension especially during sit- stand-sit and stairs ascent which the patient found the most challenging. Performance assessments during sit-stand and stair ascent were therefore our primary metrics. We hypothesized that after appropriate controller customization for the PPS patient, our novel bilateral exoskeleton would improve the results of the five times sit to stand (5xSTS) test, and time to ascend a 5-step staircase. The MMT and clinician assessment of the MS patient revealed he had reduced knee flexion strength (greatly exacerbated by quadriceps spasticity) and severely hampered hip flexion capa- bility. Functionally, his prominent deficit was leg clearance (worse on the left side) leading to compensatory circumduction. Accordingly, our primary metrics were sagittal knee and frontal shank kinematics. We hypothesized that after appropriate controller customization, exoskeleton assistance would increase the MS patient’s peak knee flexion angle (assessing leg clearance), and reduce peak shank abduction angle (assessing circumduction).  For both patients, we performed a battery of assessments to explore the effects of exoskeleton assistance for a wide array of tasks (including exploratory assessments beyond the primary out- comes described above). We performed two common gait tests: the timed up and go (TUG) test and six meter walk test (6MWT). We also assessed the times to ascend and descend a staircase and ramp.

TPAD外骨骼系统相较于其他步态训练设备在惯性负载方面具有哪些优势？
","['\nRecently, robotic training paradigms for CP children have been proposed. The most widely used device is Lokomat, which is a rigid robot that moves the lower limbs in the sagittal plane using position control (25). Studies with this device have shown mixed outcomes in gait improvements, and this was attributed to lack of the child’s active participation in the study (25–27). An overground gait train- er, “CPWalker,” was used to apply partial body weight support with control of hip flexion-extension and knees in position mode (28). Training with CPWalker was performed for 5 weeks with three CP children, but the outcomes for the posture were inconsistent (29). Another study conducted by Lerner et al. (30) used a robotic exo- skeleton that provides torque assistance to change the posture during walking and enhance the muscle’s ability to extend the limbs. Wearing the exoskeleton changed the muscle patterns and joint angles positive- ly, but the training effects without the exoskeleton were not presented. Compared with other robotic devices that could be potentially used for gait training of children with CP, TPAD offers some unique advan- tages: (i) TPAD does not add inertia to the human body. TPAD only adds 320 g on the child, which is 10 to 20 times smaller compared with other devices (24). This is important for children with small body size and weight.

本文如何通过训练提升穿戴者对外骨骼膝关节支撑期屈曲的适应性？
","['\nignored stance ﬂexion [50], [51] due to the wearer’s pref- erence. This was because the wearers might have already adapted to their previous daily passive devices, which usually locked the knee joint to a full extension for weight support during stance. In addition, some wearers reported a sense of instability when the prosthesis knee ﬂexed during stance [52]. In our study, training of the subjects helped them to become conﬁdent and comfortable with the prosthesis knee stance ﬂexion in walking. More importantly, we noted knee stance ﬂexion during early stance across all subjects from those tests that rendered the best stance time symmetry (Fig. 6). Since shock absorption after foot contact is pertinent to breaking impulse, the observation further conﬁrmed the importance of prosthesis knee control in early stance. Generating knee stance ﬂexion with eccentric torque in early stance might be necessary for prosthesis control to improve gait symmetry. However, there is no clear relationship between the prosthesis features and the gait symmetry index, and the target knee kinematics in this study cannot guarantee the best stance time symmetry for each participant. Hence, personalizing the target knee features may be necessary in order to minimize gait asymmetry.\n']","

RMS转矩跟踪误差在确定最优控制增益过程中起到了怎样的作用？
","['\nFor each combination of desired and passive stiﬀnesses, the initial session had fairly low proportional and damping gains. The gains were gradually increased across trials until perceptible oscillations were detected with maximum damping gain. Depending on the initial gains and step sizes of gain tuning, number of trials varies for each stiﬀness combination. Sometimes, the gains are lowered in the ﬁnal sessions to achieve better gain tuning resolution. On average, around ten trials were conducted for each stiﬀness combination.  Identiﬁcation of the best torque tracking performance for a speciﬁc desired and passive stiﬀness combination is crucial. The step-wise root-mean-squared (RMS) torque tracking errors averagedovertheonehundredsteadystepsforeachexperimental trial was calculated as its performance indicator.

背驱式执行器与传统执行器相比，在动力学响应方面有哪些优势？
","['\nIn treating individuals with disorders like crouch gait from CP, which has multiple potential contributing factors, it is realistic that not all individuals would respond in the same way to robotic assistance. Not surprisingly, there was a clear variation in walking ability, both with and without exoskeleton assistance, across our cohort. Qualitatively, some individuals were able to walk more naturally in the exoskeleton assist-on condition than others. The additional challenge posed by walking on the treadmill may have also contributed to this spectrum of comfort. While P5 and P6 demonstrated clinically significant improvements in knee extension for at least one parameter (e.g. peak knee extension or knee extension at initial contact) for at least one of their limbs during the exoskeleton assisted treadmill walking trials, they exhibited greater improvement during over-ground walking32. One participant (P7) visibly struggled with walking on the treadmill at baseline with only 4 strides available for analysis (Table 1). P7 also struggled to acclimate to the exoskeleton during treadmill and over-ground walking as she exhibited increased knee flexion in both the assist-on and assist-off conditions, a posture that she likely adopted to increase stability and comfort level. As a result, she also showed an increased biological knee exten- sor moment across the stance phase with the exoskeleton (Supplemental Fig. 1). It should be noted that even in this more crouched posture, the biological knee moment was reduced with the exoskeleton assist-on compared  8  to assist-off. This participant had greatly increased dorsiflexion during walking in the exoskeleton compared to baseline, suggesting that combining motorized knee assistance with an ankle condition that more closely resem- bled her prescribed AFO during typical walking would have improved outcomes. In this study, we chose to use a free ankle for all participants to isolate the effects of robotic assistance at the knee. In the future, combining the exoskeleton with an AFO at the ankle may give improved results for individuals in whom ankle dorsiflexion also contributes to crouch. Furthermore, additional walking practice with the exoskeleton would likely also improve outcomes.\n']","

The intent of the hybrid system is to provide the physiological beneﬁts associated with FES, with the reliability and control beneﬁts associated with the exoskeleton. The control approach treats the muscle stimulation as a distur- bancetoahigh-bandwidthmotorcontrolloop,andincorporatesa step-wise adaptation that shapes the stimulation proﬁle based on thetorque measurementfrom previous steps toshape the muscle “disturbance” in such a way that minimizes the required motor torque.

","['\nPanariello et al. (49) examined the effect of the squat exercise on anteroposterior knee translation in professional football players. Thirty-two subjects with normal knees participated in a 21-wk off-season conditioning program involving the parallel squat. Two periodization training cy- cles were utilized during the 21 wk. The first cycle was 12 wk in duration, immediately followed by a 9-wk cycle. The squat was performed twice a week, with subjects performing an average of 32 repetitions per session and lifting an average of 130–200% BW. A knee ligament arthrometer KT-1000 (Medmetric Corp., San Diego, CA) was used to measure anteroposterior knee stability. Both knees of each subject were tested passively and actively at 30° and 90° knee flexion before the start of the training program, at the end of the 12-wk cycle, and at the end of the 9-wk cycle. Passive anterior drawer tests were conducted with 67 N (15 lbs), 89 N (20 lbs), and 133 N (30 lbs) of force, whereas passive posterior drawer tests were conducted with 67 N and 89 N of force. Active tests were conducted with maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the quadriceps and ham- strings. Mean anterior and posterior drawer measurements were compared between the start of the training program and the end of the 12-wk cycle, between the end of the 12-wk cycle and the end of the 9-wk cycle, and between the start of the training program and the end of the 9-wk cycle. There were no significant differences between any pair of pre- and post-exercise measurements, and no significant differences in anteroposterior knee translations in athletes using the squat as part of their training regimen. Hence, it was deduced that the squat is a safe exercise to include in an athlete’s training program.  CONCLUSIONS  This review examined knee biomechanics during the dy- namic squat exercise.

实验如何验证髋关节助力时机与步行代谢成本之间的关系？主要实验结果指标是什么？
","['\nRecent work with hip and ankle exoskeletons has focused on the goal of reducing the metabolic cost of walking, and research- ers have succeeded in a number of experiments (Ronsse et al., 2011; Mooney et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2016a,b; Ruiz Garate et al., 2016; Seo et al., 2016). Research groups have used both rigid exoskeletons (Ruiz Garate et al., 2016), as we use in our experiment, and soft exoskeletons to test the effect of different hip assistance strategies on metabolic output (Ding et al., 2016a; Panizzolo et al., 2016). A wide variety of control systems have been proposed (Aguirre-Ollinger, 2013; Jang et al., 2015; Koller et al., 2015; Oh et al., 2015; Takahashi et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2015; Ao et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2016), but typically tests are done on a unique device with only one controller. Oscillator-based controllers tend to be popular for hip exoskeletons due to the reliance on only hip joint angle sensing for control (Ronsse et al., 2011; Giovacchini et al., 2014; Seo et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016; Sugar et al., 2017). More recent exoskeletons are becoming completely autonomous, using oscillation-based approaches to provide walking assistance that reduces the metabolic cost of walking (Seo et al., 2016).  The overall aim of this work was to determine the optimal tim- ing for supplying hip power using an exoskeleton to assist human walking. This is a useful goal to aid the field in understanding the relationship between hip assistance timing and metabolic cost of walking. The experiment aimed to identify separately the value of hip flexion and hip extension assistance and determine the best timing interval during the gait cycle for supplying powered assistance for both movement types. The primary outcome meas- ure was the metabolic cost of walking. We hypothesized that the controller timings that generated a pattern of exoskeleton torque most similar to the biological torque pattern would produce  the largest reduction in metabolic cost (Malcolm et al., 2013). A secondary outcome measure was user preference. We tested the hypothesis that users would prefer conditions with powered assistive timing that incurred a lower metabolic cost on the user. The primary aim achieved was assessing the effects of hip timing on human performance using an exoskeleton.  MaTerials anD MeThODs\n']","

The lower limbs have increased extension after the training, showing stronger soleus muscles. Improved vertical pelvic ROM and decreas- ing trend of trunk angle are also observed. In addition, children who participated in this study showed improvements in walking ability, for example, step length, walking speed, symmetry, and foot clearance.

自对准外骨骼设计中的伪力和力矩是如何受关节轴线不对准影响的？实验数据如何支持这一结论？
","['\nThe goal of the pDOFs is to prevent the spurious forces and torques on the user’s limb that can result from misalignments. the proposed self-aligning We hypothesized exoskeleton, misalignments between the exoskeleton joint axes will not result in an increase of spurious forces and torques on the user. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the interaction forces between the exoskeleton and the user across different alignment and assistance conditions. The analysis of the interaction forces (Fig. 11 and Fig. 13) shows that the spurious forces (Fx and Fy) and torques (Tx, Ty, Tz) were not visibly affected by the assistance level. On the other hand, Fz increased with the level of assistance. This result is not surprising given that Fz is roughly perpendicular to the user shank, and, therefore, it is not a spurious load. Relatively large standard deviations were observed in measured interaction forces (Fig. 11). The large standard deviation in Fz is likely due to inter-subject variability in sit-to-stand timing as our controller allows the subjects to stand up at their preferred speed. The standard deviations in all other forces and torques, are large relative to the value of the mean because the measured values themselves are small. The linear regression analysis showed that no forces or torques other than Fz were significantly correlated to the assistive joint torque. The measured peaks of the spurious forces and torques were 5 N and 0.5 Nm, respectively (Fig. 11). To put these numbers in perspective, a previous study [11] testing similar misalignment conditions using a powered exoskeleton with no self-aligning mechanism showed spurious forces and torques up to 50 N and 10 Nm, respectively. Thus, the analysis of the interaction forces and torques supports our hypothesis.  that,  in  the user and  B. Design and Control  The pDOFs in a self-aligning mechanism should be designed to work smoothly under the high load generated by the actuation system during assistance. The pDOFs should also be lightweight and unobtrusive, as adding significant weight or dimension to the exoskeleton may negate its assistive function [30].

自主式关节靶向外骨骼如何在不承重的前提下实现高效的力矩传递？
","['\nThe mechanical designs and control strategies of joint-targeting exoskeletons with offboard actuation can be easily modified to explore the different physiological impacts of the designs; however, these sys- tems are restricted to treadmill-based studies, which may not reflect typical features of walking (such as changes in speed, direction or terrain). By contrast, autonomous systems allow the wearer to freely navigate unconstrained environments. The aim of joint-targeting exoskeletons is not to bear weight, hence autonomous devices do not require large rigid structures. However, rigid components are benefi- cial for efficiently transferring torques to the body; for example, rigid  Nature Biomedical Engineering  components and a distal actuator at the ankle decrease the metabolic cost of loaded and unloaded walking in unimpaired individuals69,70,87.

如何通过表面肌电图（EMG）数据评估多地形任务中股四头肌的整体肌肉用力？
","['\n5.2.2.3 Multi-terrain Quadriceps Effort  In session 2, after appropriate skin preparation, we secured five electromyography (EMG) electrodes (Trigno Avanti and Snap, Delsys, Massachusetts, USA) onto the subject’s right vas- tus medialis oblique (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), and  59  semitendinosus (ST) to assess muscle activation. Participants performed a maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) procedure comprising explosive jump squats (eliciting maximal dynamic con- traction) and maximal isometric contraction against manual resistance, which enabled EMG data to be normalized to %MVC.  To assess muscular effort we calculated the mean of the MVC-normalized RMS signal for each gait/task cycle. The RMS signal provided by the Delsys EMG acquisition software was used for this purpose (RMS window length: 125 ms, 122 ms overlap). The muscle recruitment pattern of the individual quadriceps muscles varies both intra- and inter-participant, but the force exerted by these muscles is similar for the same level of neural activation (due to similar cross-sectional areas). Since we were interested in gross quadriceps effort, and to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in our statistical analysis, we averaged the muscle efforts of the 3 quadriceps muscles that we recorded to get a gross quadriceps effort metric.  5.2.3 Statistical Analysis  We first confirmed normality of our data using QQ-plots. Muscular effort was analyzed using a linear mixed model (LMM) in MATLAB with restricted maximum likelihood estimation of pa- rameters. Data from our eight subjects were tabulated with information consisting of quadriceps muscle effort, condition (bare, exoskeleton), and gender (male, female). We defined exoskeleton conditions and gender as categorical variables and fit a separate LMM for each task, where the condition and gender are fixed effects and subject is a random effect:  Effort ∼ Condition+Gender+(1|Subject).\n']","

自适应阻抗控制如何实现人机协同中的动态稳定性调节？
","['\nactivity during the  Knee Stability  Knee stability is paramount in enhancing an athlete’s performance and training, minimizing injury potential, or improving a patient’s knee rehabilitation. Normal tibial in- ternal rotation in knee flexion and tibial external rotation in knee extension (i.e., the screw home mechanism) that occurs when the foot is free to move changes during the squat exercise. Instead, the femur tends to rotate externally during knee flexion and internally during knee extension. As the femur externally rotates during the descent, the tibia also attempts to externally rotate. This is supported Costigan and Reid (12), who demonstrated that during the squat the tibia generated an external rotation torque against the ground during knee flexion and an internal rotation torque during knee extension. The flexion, extension, internal rotation, and external rotation knee movements that occur during the squat are supported in part by cruciate and collateral knee ligaments, which help provide knee stability. The ACL and PCL provide anteroposterior knee stability, while the MCL and LCL provide mediolateral knee stability. Knee ligament arthrometers can be employed to quantify anteroposterior  http://www.acsm-msse.org  and mediolateral knee stability by measuring anteroposte- rior and mediolateral tibial translation relative to the femur. This is important because excessive anteroposterior or me- diolateral knee translation measurements may indicate knee instability due to damage to the cruciate or collateral liga- ments. To date, there are seven known studies that examined how the dynamic squat affects anteroposterior or mediolat- eral knee stability (5,10,21,28,37,49,57).\n']","

However, joint, did not consider joint kinetics, and was never experi- mentally validated. Recently, [29] proposed a similar variable impedance controller where ankle stiffness and damping were deﬁned as polynomials in phase, and the coefﬁcients deﬁn- ing the polynomials were identiﬁed using constrained least squares with an able-bodied kinematic and kinetic dataset. The authors utilized piecewise-constant equilibrium angles and demonstrated continuous stiffness and damping expressions that produced satisfactory gait with a post-optimization tuning protocol. This work was later extended to include variable inclines and a phase variable parameterization of stiffness and damping based on the phase portrait of the thigh angle and its integral [30]. However, this phase variable is known to have challenges with non-steady walking [33], and changes in impedance associated with walking speed were not considered. The authors of [30] also note that their method of identifying the impedance parameters is non-convex, which does not guarantee a globally optimal solution [34] for their controller. This paper addresses these limitations by presenting a new phase-based, task-adaptive walking controller built on a hy- brid combination of continuously-variable impedance control during stance and kinematic control during swing (Fig. 1). Stance impedance control allows the controller to regulate the dynamic interaction between the user and the ground while swing kinematic control provides the user with indirect volitional control over foot position. We use an able-bodied kinematic and kinetic dataset [21] with constrained convex optimization to create a continuous model of stance joint stiffness, damping, and equilibrium angle, each parameterized by phase, walking speed, and ground incline. Paired with an analogous model of swing joint kinematics, our hybrid controller produces a biomimetic gait across varying tasks based on real-time phase and task estimates.\n']","

","['\nThe Utah ExoKnee uses a PID controller with a DOB after [35]. Bench top testing (Fig. 5) show that the performance of the proposed torque controller (i.e., 22.3 Hz -3dB bandwidth) should be sufficient to assist common activities of daily living based on the data in [36], [37]. However, in this paper, we only focused on sit-to-stand transitions, which require high torque and low speed (Fig. 4). Additional experiments should be performed to validate the performance of the torque controller on ambulation activities that require low torque and high speed, such as walking.  C. Limitations  The interaction torque in the X-axis (Tx, parallel to the user’s shank) was not compensated for by a pDOF. Given the symmetric design of the proposed exoskeleton, it should be possible to add a rotational pDOF in the X-axis while still being able to transfer assistive torque in the sagittal plane. This pDOF could be implemented, for example, using a custom curvilinear guide as done in [12], [38]. Further studies are necessary to investigate the viability and effect of adding this additional pDOF.  For the purpose of this study, the peak torque during sit-to- stand transitions was regulated by the experimenter. However, customization of assistance level to the user needs is necessary. Future work should investigate scaling the assistance levels by  2576-3202 (c) 2020 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.

First, we introduced a general-purpose, modular, convex- optimization-based framework for multi-task optimized energy shaping (M-TOES). This frame- work extended our previous optimization framework (in study 1) by adding certain key features of modular energy bases, convex penalties on incorrect torque sign, and unification of stance and swing controllers by use of the vertical GRF. Second, we rigorously analyzed the behavior of the target energy resulting from these controllers, including all possible power leaks due to practical relaxations of the matching conditions (criteria that determine the allowable kinematic inputs to the basis functions) and passivity. Third, we empirically validated the stability, modularity, and task-invariance of the resulting controllers with N = 8 able-bodied participants performing the pri- mary activities of daily life with four different configurations of the M-BLUE system: unilateral hip, bilateral hip, unilateral knee, and bilateral knee. For each modular configuration of the de- vice, the M-TOES controller is optimized across multiple tasks (including multi-speed walking, ramps, stairs, start-stop, and sit-to-stand tasks) from able-bodied datasets [Camargo et al., 2021; Laschowski et al., 2021].

How much force the quadriceps tendon can generate before rupture is unclear. However, because Nisell and Ekholm (42) found that the thickness and breadth of the quadriceps tendon to be 35–40% greater than the thickness and breadth of the patellar tendon, it is likely that the ultimate strength of the quadriceps tendon is greater than the 10,000–15,000 N estimate for the ultimate strength of the patellar tendon. The peak posterior shear force reported by Nisell and Ekholm (43) is similar to the peak PCL tensile force calcu- lated by Escamilla et al. (17,18) and Wilk et al.

INTRODUCTION  CEREBRAL palsy (CP)  child-onset is neuromuscular disorders and is the most common motor disability in childhood [1]. Individuals with CP have abnormal and inefﬁcient walking patterns [2] that can worsen with age until ambulatory ability is lost [3]. Surgical intervention for pathological walking patterns in individuals with CP, such as tendon lengthening, have proven to be only moderately effective in improving long-term mobility [4], [5]. Ankle- foot-orthoses (AFOs), commonly prescribed for ambulatory children with CP, also only have limited long-term beneﬁts on gait and mobility [6], [7].  a  set of  associated with CP are characterized by signiﬁcantly reduced positive ankle joint power during push-off [8], increased hip and knee joint ﬂexion, and reduced ankle plantarﬂexion and plantar-ﬂexor [9]. These inefﬁcient gait mechanics drastically power decrease walking speed [10], increase the energy cost of walking [11], and reduce levels of physical activity [12]. There is clear need for effective interventions that can improve free-living mobility, walking speed, and efﬁciency.  Pathological  gait  patterns  Powered ankle exoskeletons have demonstrated potential to reduce metabolic cost of transport during controlled treadmill walking. Several studies utilizing different exoskeleton designs during treadmill walking have reduced metabolic cost of trans- port in unimpaired adults [13]–[16]. In a feasibility study with CP participants, powered plantarﬂexion assistance provided by an untethered exoskeleton during treadmill walking improved net metabolic cost of transport in CP participants by 19 ± 5% compared to walking without wearing the device [17].

如何通过用户压力中心投影位移触发外骨骼步态周期的切换？
","[""\nin [38], each successive step is initiated by a shift in the loca- tion of the projection of the user's estimated center of pressure (CoP) alongthe groundinthe sagittal plane, relative to the user's forward foot (i.e., when the CoP projection shifts forward to a sufﬁcient extent, the subsequent step will be triggered). When a right step is triggered (i.e., when state 1 is entered), predeter- mined joint angle proﬁles (given in [38]) are used as input in the controlloopsfortherightkneeandhipcontrolloops(forswing), and for the left hip control loop (for stance), while the left knee is locked. Additionally, the most recent right quadriceps stim- ulation proﬁle is used as input to the right knee control loop, and the most recent left hamstrings stimulation proﬁle is used asinputtothelefthipcontrolloop.Once the rightstephasended (i.e., the joint trajectories are complete), the FSM enters state 2, and motors alone are used to hold the double-support posture. When a left step is triggered based on the projected CoP (i.e., when state 3 is entered), the predetermined joint angle proﬁles (given in [38]) are used as input in the control loops for the left knee and hip control loops (for swing), and for the right hip con- trol loop (for stance), while the right knee is locked. Addition- ally, the most recent left quadriceps stimulation proﬁle is used as input to the left knee control loop, and the most recent right hamstrings stimulation proﬁle is used as input to the right hip control loop. Note that in the states for which a given joint does not utilize stimulation, the control structure remains as shown in Fig. 1, with the stimulation proﬁle set to zero (i.e., the controller simply tracks a given trajectory with motors only).

用户压力中心（CoP）投影位移通过在矢状面内相对于用户前脚向前移动一定距离来触发外骨骼步态周期的切换。当CoP投影达到触发阈值时，系统识别为下一步开始，进而激活相应的控制回路：右步触发时使用右膝和左髋控制回路（摆动期与支撑期），并激活右膝与左髋刺激；左步触发时则激活左膝与右髋控制回路，同时激活相应的刺激。步态切换后，系统根据预设的关节角度轮廓和最新刺激轮廓进行控制，支撑期仅使用电机，摆动期则结合刺激与电机驱动。前五个步未使用刺激，系统通过平均扭矩建立基准，为后续步态周期提供输入。

在楼梯行走任务中，关节角度位移相较于平地行走有哪些显著差异？
","['\nA fundamental consideration, already pointed out in the work of McFadyen and Winter [10] is that the ascending task consists primarily of a transfer of mus- cle energy into potential (gravitation) energy of the body. Our experiment results also showed that muscle activity generally increased with backpack load in- creasing, the RMS of gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, hamstring and rectus femoris are significantly greater with the maximum loads compared to the no-load condition.  Table 1 showed that the stride time increased with increasing load during stair climbing and level walk- ing. The explanation for this prolonged stance phase might come from the requirement to maintain good body balance. The load carried on the back raised the center of gravity of the locomotor system, thus di- minishing the stability of equilibrium. The subjects were forced to adjust their gait to compensate for this change by lengthening the stance duration (or reduc- ing the swing duration) [6], [8].  joint angular displacements during stair climbing are similar to those reported by Nadeau and Riener et al. [12], [14]. In comparison to level walk- ing, the lower limbs were observed to be more flexed at the beginning of the foot strike and less extension at the hip was observed at toe-off. These observations reflected specific adaptations to the staircase envi- ronment. The knee and hip need to be flexed at foot contact to place the leg on the step. At the end of the stance phase of stair climbing, the hips do not need to extend as much as in level walking because the con- tralateral step length is reduced by the geometry of the staircase, as opposed to level walking where there is no such constraint. As supported by previous studies [14], these differences in the range of motion between stair climbing and level walking may depend of the staircase configuration and subject characteristics. The angular displacements at the hip and knee were simi- lar to those reported in studies using two-dimensional analyses [11].  The\n']","

如何通过自适应阻抗控制实现外骨骼系统中人机协同的稳定性？
","['\ning exercise for the treatment of crouch gait (39); TPAD training with downward pelvic pull could be a promising intervention for these children.  After training, children presented increased extension of the knee and plantar flexion of the ankle. This is explained by the increased activity of the soleus muscle, which prevents the progression of the tibia during the stance and allows the knees to extend due to momen- tum of the center of mass. The improved timing of the gastrocnemius also contributed to knee extension, because the gastrocnemius acti- vated less during the early stance phase to prevent knee flexion of the crouch gait. Improved muscle activation of soleus and gastrocnemius also increased the plantar flexion of the ankle during the push-off phase. However, hip extension cannot be directly explained by those two muscles. Hip extension can increase due to activation of the muscles that were not measured in the present study, such as gluteus maximus, adductor magnus, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus. Another possible explanation is that the changed posture of the knee and ankle enabled the hip to extend more easily. In crouch gait, the hip requires larger torque for extension because the knee is leaning forward, and the body weight vector creates a larger moment arm to flex the hip (9).

As such, it is hypothesized that a portion of the elevated EMG seen in the gravity compensation experiment was due to the (sagittal plane) constraints on motion imposed by the exoskeleton. Specifically, slight changes in the plane of movement may increase the level of muscular co-contraction required to flex the hip joint, and therefore the presence of the exoskeleton may slightly increase quadriceps EMG during hip flexion due to secondary factors. Although the exoskeleton is easily capable of providing additional gravity compensation (which can offset the increase in EMG), the authors chose instead to maintain the level of gravity compensation that is appropriate in the absence of a subject, and thus used the settings indicated in Fig. 4 (and Table I) in the level walking experiments described subsequently. B. Inertia and Friction Compensation In order to reduce the effects of added inertia, hip and knee joint torques are supplemented in proportion to the respective angular acceleration of the joint,  ( ) (2) where θ is the angular position of that joint, and where the constant of proportionality (i.e., the effective rotational inertia) was determined experimentally by iteratively increasing the value.

在步态活动转换评估中，PV+CS分类方法相较于LDA和PV单独使用有哪些性能优势？
","['\nIf the switching sensitivity gain as described in (7) is too high, the classifier may be resistant to switching states in order to classify a new activity. If this gain is too low, the confidence- based switching will provide no additional benefit over the phase variable approach alone. The switching sensitivity gain was chosen by tuning the gain in order to maximize the classification accuracy on a single subject using subject- specific training data. This gain value was then used in all other applications of the hysteretic switching algorithm. To assess the activity switching aspect of the proposed algorithm, gait activity transitions were simulated by concatenating gait data from steady state activities into a single set of data. All six possible transitions between the three gait activities (see Fig. 3) were simulated in this way and the strides were classified by all three classification algorithms: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), the phase variable classifier (PV), and the phase variable classifier supplemented with the confidence-based switching (PV+CS). Gait transition data was classified using subject-specific training data and non-subject-specific training data via the previously described method of leave-one-out cross validation.  IV. RESULTS  Although each element in the classification vector nominally corresponds to the RMS of the divergence rate over an entire stride, the classification vectors for the thigh input were calculated using only the final 75% (i.e., 0.25 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 1.0) of the stride (i.e., the first 25% of each stride was excluded from consideration in all activities due to the relatively large inter- stride variability observed in the thigh input). If not excluded, the high variability in thigh motion specifically associated with the beginning of stair ascent would negatively affect classifier accuracy, which depends on gait consistency. Following computation of the respective classification vectors, the accuracy of the classifier was assessed by calculating the percentage of accurately classified strides for each individual gait activity. In each case, the stride was classified in the class corresponding to the smallest element in the classification vector. In all accuracy calculations, all walking data was considered regardless of cadence to determine if the approach is robust to variations in step frequency.\n']","

自对准外骨骼设计中的伪力和力矩是如何受关节轴线不对准影响的？实验数据如何支持这一结论？
","['\nThe goal of the pDOFs is to prevent the spurious forces and torques on the user’s limb that can result from misalignments. the proposed self-aligning We hypothesized exoskeleton, misalignments between the exoskeleton joint axes will not result in an increase of spurious forces and torques on the user. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the interaction forces between the exoskeleton and the user across different alignment and assistance conditions. The analysis of the interaction forces (Fig. 11 and Fig. 13) shows that the spurious forces (Fx and Fy) and torques (Tx, Ty, Tz) were not visibly affected by the assistance level. On the other hand, Fz increased with the level of assistance. This result is not surprising given that Fz is roughly perpendicular to the user shank, and, therefore, it is not a spurious load. Relatively large standard deviations were observed in measured interaction forces (Fig. 11). The large standard deviation in Fz is likely due to inter-subject variability in sit-to-stand timing as our controller allows the subjects to stand up at their preferred speed. The standard deviations in all other forces and torques, are large relative to the value of the mean because the measured values themselves are small. The linear regression analysis showed that no forces or torques other than Fz were significantly correlated to the assistive joint torque. The measured peaks of the spurious forces and torques were 5 N and 0.5 Nm, respectively (Fig. 11). To put these numbers in perspective, a previous study [11] testing similar misalignment conditions using a powered exoskeleton with no self-aligning mechanism showed spurious forces and torques up to 50 N and 10 Nm, respectively. Thus, the analysis of the interaction forces and torques supports our hypothesis.  that,  in  the user and  B. Design and Control  The pDOFs in a self-aligning mechanism should be designed to work smoothly under the high load generated by the actuation system during assistance.

","['\n. The peak quadriceps tendon force observed was the same as the 8,000 N peak force reported by van Eijden et al. (63). How much force the quadriceps tendon can generate before rupture is unclear. However, because Nisell and Ekholm (42) found that the thickness and breadth of the quadriceps tendon to be 35–40% greater than the thickness and breadth of the patellar tendon, it is likely that the ultimate strength of the quadriceps tendon is greater than the 10,000–15,000 N estimate for the ultimate strength of the patellar tendon. The peak posterior shear force reported by Nisell and Ekholm (43) is similar to the peak PCL tensile force calcu- lated by Escamilla et al. (17,18) and Wilk et al.

S-Assist采用钢缆驱动的下肢关节在刚度特性上达到了怎样的性能指标？
","['\nThe proposed ADP mechanism extends the RCM charac- teristic not only to the parallelogram structure, but also to the general tetragonal structure. Using this tetragon’s char- acteristics, we can remove the symmetrical constraint of a general double parallelogram. As shown in Fig. 6(b), based on the ADP mechanism, we designed the coaxial internal RCM axis for the inversion/eversion joint while minimizing its bulge height.  C. Tendon-Driven Remote Actuation  Four active joints (one hip ﬂexion/extension and one knee ﬂexion/extension joint per leg) are remotely controlled by tendon-driven actuators. This enables the proposed S-Assist to tightly ﬁt so that the it can be worn under clothing. Instead of mounting each actuator beside the wearer’s lower limb joint as in conventional exoskeletons, the actuators are packed inside a backpack. Compared to direct-driven actuation, including a motor/reducer at each joint, the lower limb of the S-Assist can be designed to be slimmer and more compact in the proposed design.  Tendon-driven actuation provides several advantages, in- cluding low mass/inertia, and stiff transmission via arbitrarily ﬂexible and complex pathways. The joints of the S-Assist are actuated by highly efﬁcient and back-drivable ball-screw linear actuators (Fig. 7(a)), which give the wearer natural inertia for the lower limb without adding considerable impedance. By using a steel cable (2096 by Carl Stahl SAVA Industries, Inc.) of diameter 2.4mm, the joint stiffness of the hip can be increased up to 233Nm/rad, which is sufﬁcient for human- robot interaction devices.  A Maxon EC-4 pole 90W brushless motor (36V) along with a 190:1 reducer consisting of a timing pulley and a linear ball screw are attached to the actuator pack. The ball screw translates the rotational motion into a linear movement. The actuator is designed for a linear stroke of 85mm and a maximum pulling force of 750N to satisfy its ROM and maximum torque. These values are based on the moment arm of the corresponding joint, desired joint ranges, torques, and velocities listed in Table II. The volume of the whole actuator package is about 230mm×240mm×40mm, and it totally weighs 2.4kg.  The operation of the proposed ADP can be explained by  1083-4435 (c) 2016 IEEE.

腓肠肌在深蹲动作的下降和上升阶段分别起到什么力学作用，其活动如何影响股四头肌的发力需求？
","['\n134  Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine  greater hip extensor torque and less knee extensor torque compared with the high-bar squat. Mean peak knee extensor torques are typically between 100 and 300 Nzm during the barbell squat (3,17,30,36,43,58,66,68,69). Because these torques are resultant (i.e., net) torques, they represent the sum of all flexor and extensor knee torques. For example, a 500-Nzm extensor torque and a 300-Nzm flexor torque yield a 200-Nzm resultant torque. Hence, it cannot be deduced that lower knee extensor torque equates to less quadriceps force being produced in the powerlifters, although it is enticing to do so. Less quadriceps force would indeed explain why peak patellofemoral compressive force was less in powerlifters, because quadriceps tendon force and patellar tendon force would also be less. However, EMG data from Wretenberg et al. (68) show greater quadriceps and hamstring activity in the low-bar squat compared to the high-bar squat. Because the hamstrings produce a knee flexor torque, a greater knee extensor torque would be needed. Hence, greater quadriceps force would be needed to generate this force. In addition, gastrocnemius force can also cause the quadriceps to gen- erate more force during the squat, because the gastrocne- mius also generates a knee flexor torque by their duel role as knee flexors and ankle plantar flexors. Moderate gastroc- nemius activity has been observed during the squat (13,17,18), which is needed during the squat to control ankle dorsiflexion during the descent and cause ankle plantar flexion during the ascent.\n']","

The figure shows the ensemble averaged frontal plane global shank angle profiles for bare and exo conditions (adduction angles are positive) for the left (highly impaired) leg.  92  CHAPTER 7  Conclusions and Future Work  The focus of this dissertation is on the control and pre-clinical validation of lower-limb partial assist exoskeletons, i.e., developing and assessing assistance schemes applicable to improving mo- bility in broad populations that retain a certain level of voluntary motion. More specifically, the dissertation’s goal was twofold and constituted: 1) designing an intuitive, and customizable “task- invariant” controller for lower limb backdrivable exoskeletons to assist both healthy and impaired users over multiple terrain in multiple activities; and 2) performing pre-clinical in-vivo experi- ments designed to investigate the effect of this partial assistance scheme on critical, multifaceted human variables.  The primary justification for this goal arose from both mechanical, and controls related gaps in the state-of-the-art lower limb robotic assistance technologies for individuals with remnant vol- untary ability. Mainly, this group of individuals requires control schemes that command assistive torques based on live kinematic feedback of their limbs; and thereby require a mechanical actuation system that least impedes this voluntary motion. However, at the start of my dissertation several years ago, partial assistance exoskeleton technology was in an early transition phase from a dis- tinctly different exoskeleton class—bulky, powerful exoskeletons with highly geared (and thereby stiff) actuators for “driving” the limbs of paralyzed individuals with negligible voluntary force pro- duction capability [van Kammen et al., 2020]. Accordingly, my research lab progressed through three major versions of exoskeletons (Comex 1, Comex 2, and MBLUE), with each subsequent version being lighter and more backdrivable. In order to address the first part of the goal, it was important to firstly assess the existing partial assist controllers on available hardware (related to the second part of the goal).\n']","

ABSTRACT Task-speciﬁc, trajectory-based control methods commonly used in exoskeletons may be ap- propriate for individuals with paraplegia, but they overly constrain the volitional motion of individuals with remnant voluntary ability (representing a far larger population). Human-exoskeleton systems can be represented in the form of the Euler-Lagrange equations or, equivalently, the port-controlled Hamil- tonian equations to design control laws that provide task-invariant assistance across a continuum of activities/environments by altering energetic properties of the human body. We previously introduced a port-controlled Hamiltonian framework that parameterizes the control law through basis functions related to gravitational and gyroscopic terms, which are optimized to ﬁt normalized able-bodied joint torques across multiple walking gaits on different ground inclines. However, this approach did not have the ﬂexibility to reproduce joint torques for a broader set of activities, including stair climbing and stand-to-sit, due to strict assumptions related to input-output passivity, which ensures the human remains in control of energy growth in the closed-loop dynamics. To provide biomimetic assistance across all primary activities of daily life, this paper generalizes this energy shaping framework by incorporating vertical ground reaction forces and global planar orientation into the basis set, while preserving passivity between the human joint torques and human joint velocities. We present an experimental implementation on a powered knee-ankle exoskeleton used by three able-bodied human subjects during walking on various inclines, ramp ascent/descent, and stand-to-sit, demonstrating the versatility of this control approach and its effect on muscular effort.

Powered robotic exoskeletons are promising tools to deliver high-dosage, high-intensity, and progressive therapy, and to enable greater stepping workloads during therapy while po- tentially reducing strain on therapists. The Stride Management Assist (SMA) exoskeleton, developed by Honda R&D Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), has a low weight (;6 pounds) and simpliﬁed, modular design relative to other clinically tested exoskeletons to date. Gait training with the SMA has been shown to improve muscle eﬃciency,2 energetic cost,3 and poststroke paretic step length and spatial asymmetry.4 At present, it is uncertain how long-term training with the SMA aﬀects traditional poststroke clinical measures (e.g., walking speed, endurance, balance).  Insuﬃcient central drive and an imbalance of between- hemispheresymmetryofcorticomotorexcitability(CME)are also a well-established benchmark after stroke.5,6 However, there is limited information about the eﬀect of gait training on changes in cortical activity. Several studies have shown that improvements in walking and lower limb motor performance are related to cortical reorganization occurring after stroke— speciﬁcally, improvements in excitability of the paretic lower limb muscle representations.7,8 Thus, it is expected that inter- ventions enabling greater stepping dosage and intensity would strengthen connections between the motor areas of the brain and muscles of the lower limb.\n']","

For example, it has been demonstrated that tailored assistance based on HITL optimization can decrease the net metabolic cost of walking by up to 50% using metabolic cost as feedback [9].  In this study, we aimed at demonstrating that a hip exoskeleton, initially developed for walking assistance, can be effectively repurposed to substantially lower the metabolic cost of cycling as measured by the net metabolic cost. To explore a range of assistance strategies, we employed two methods: (1) a brute force search with a sweep protocol that evaluates a large range of solutions and (2) human-in-the-loop optimization. The sweep protocol linearly adjusted the timing of a 10Nm peak extension torque ranging from 10% to 40% of the pedal stroke and a 10Nm peak flexion torque ranging from 60% to 90% of the pedal stroke. The HITL optimization used the peak timing of extension and flexion torque as a free parameter and the net metabolic cost as the optimization criterion. HITL optimization was performed to validate the results of the sweep protocol and to explore its potential to identify an individualized assistance strategy in cycling. We hypothesized that both methods are able to identify similar solutions that reduce the net metabolic cost of cycling. While maintaining the peak torque, we assumed that the fixed kinematics of the bicycle and the predefined cycling cadence favor assistance strategies with rapid increases in the exoskeleton torque and therefore provide increased average motor power to assist the participants.  2.

The manual muscle test (MMT) and clinician assessment of the PPS patient revealed that he had a highly impaired (atrophied) right  75  leg from the hip down, and quadriceps weakness in his left side. Accordingly, discussion with the patient and on-site clinician highlighted the need to assist knee extension especially during sit- stand-sit and stairs ascent which the patient found the most challenging. Performance assessments during sit-stand and stair ascent were therefore our primary metrics. We hypothesized that after appropriate controller customization for the PPS patient, our novel bilateral exoskeleton would improve the results of the five times sit to stand (5xSTS) test, and time to ascend a 5-step staircase. The MMT and clinician assessment of the MS patient revealed he had reduced knee flexion strength (greatly exacerbated by quadriceps spasticity) and severely hampered hip flexion capa- bility. Functionally, his prominent deficit was leg clearance (worse on the left side) leading to compensatory circumduction. Accordingly, our primary metrics were sagittal knee and frontal shank kinematics. We hypothesized that after appropriate controller customization, exoskeleton assistance would increase the MS patient’s peak knee flexion angle (assessing leg clearance), and reduce peak shank abduction angle (assessing circumduction).  For both patients, we performed a battery of assessments to explore the effects of exoskeleton assistance for a wide array of tasks (including exploratory assessments beyond the primary out- comes described above). We performed two common gait tests: the timed up and go (TUG) test and six meter walk test (6MWT). We also assessed the times to ascend and descend a staircase and ramp.

传统下肢假肢阻抗控制方法在步态周期分相中存在哪些局限性？
","['\n(1)  where K, B, and θeq are parameters deﬁning the joint’s stiffness, damping, and equilibrium angle, respectively.  Traditional methods of impedance control for lower-limb prostheses involve segmenting the gait cycle into discrete sub- phases, where each sub-phase has its own constant values of K, B, and θeq. Researchers manually tune the impedance parameters in each sub-phase until the observed gait is sat- isfactory [5], [11], [14]–[17]. Switching between sub-phases is controlled by a ﬁnite state machine (FSM) with transition criteria based on sensor readings (e.g., elapsed time, leg loading, joint angles, etc.). Like the impedance parameters, these transition criteria are often experimentally tuned for an individual’s gait by a technical expert. More elaborate impedance value representations have been suggested [16]– [19], but these methods still required manual, expert tuning. Joint kinematics and kinetics vary based on the ground incline and walking speed [20], [21] (together termed the user’s task). Therefore, the necessary impedance parameters and state machine transition criteria also vary. For a standard FSM impedance controller to operate over a wide array of tasks, many tunable parameters are required. For example, one state-of-the-art impedance controller for ﬁve ambulation modes required a total of 140 tunable parameters [16]. While only a portion of these parameters were considered necessary to tune, the device’s conﬁguration and tuning still required the researchers up to ﬁve hours to complete. To avoid the expert tuning burden, other work aimed to eliminate manual tuning by using biological quasi-stiffness curves [17], [22]–[24] or using machine learning to perform online parameter tuning [25], [26]. However, many of these approaches were limited to level-ground walking. Further, while [24]–[26] addressed the problem of tuning the impedance parameters, their approaches still required tuning the FSM switching criteria.\n']","

与传统周期训练方法相比，分期训练技术在外骨骼控制应用中的主要优势是什么？
","['\nThe rate of increase in compressive force is maximum between approximately 50–80° knee flexion (17,18), thus generating proportionately greater patellofemoral force compared with lower knee flexion angles. Therefore, per- forming the squat within the functional range of 0–50° knee flexion will minimize patellofemoral compressive force and stress, and may be effective for athletes or patients with patellofemoral pathologies. For athletes with healthy knees, performing the squat at higher knee flexion angles (approx- imately 90–110°) should not be problematic, as long as heavy loads are not used excessively. This can be a potential problem for powerlifters and football players, who often train with heavy loads for long periods of time. Periodiza- tion techniques should be employed when performing the squat, in which training is divided into light, medium, and heavy intensity cycles throughout the year.  Muscle Activity  To determine which muscles are being developed during the squat and to what degree, it is helpful to quantify muscle activity through the use of EMG. To date, there are 16 known studies that  KNEE BIOMECHANICS OF THE DYNAMIC SQUAT EXERCISE  havequantifiedmuscleactivityaboutthekneeduringthedynamic squat (6,13,17,18,25,27,34,38,40,54,55,58,65,68–70). Eleven of these studies performed the barbell squat with an external load (17,18,34,40,54,55,58,65,68–70), whereas the remaining five studies (6,13,25,27,38) performed the BW squat. The pri- mary knee muscles utilized during the squat are the quad- riceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius, and co-contractions among these muscles are believed to enhance knee stability (15,16,31,46,47,73,74).  Escamilla et al. (17) and Wilk et al. (65) quantified quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius activity using a 12-RM load for 10 male subjects experienced in the squat. Quadriceps activity progressively increased as the knee flexed and decreased as the knees extended, with peak activity occurring at approximately 80–90° knee flexion. Similar results were observed in several other studies (18,27,40,55,58,69). Quadriceps activity remained fairly constant beyond 80–90° knee flexion, which has also been observed in other studies (58,68,69). Hence, descending beyond 90° knee flexion, which is near the parallel squat position, may not enhance quadriceps development.\n']","

Of note, the results for predicting the hip, knee, and ankle joint moment during walking and running with a single IMU is quite promising, which is nearly equivalent to the performance of multiple IMUs. Moreover, the average PCC of hip, knee, and ankle joint moments reach up to 0.95, 0.90, and 0.92 during running at different speeds. Accurate estimation of joint moment with the proposed model during walking and running is critical for the injury assessment in daily life.

EXPERIMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION The previously described control approach was implemented on a paraplegic subject wearing the previously described lower limb exoskeleton. These experiments were conducted using electrical stimulation of the quadriceps muscle, therefore only the knee joint utilized cooperative control, and only when requiring a torque in knee extension (i.e., the quadriceps cannot provide a knee flexion torque).

All experiments were conducted at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta GA USA, a hospital specializing in spinal cord injury. All experiments required the presence of a physical therapist, as per the experimental protocol approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board. A. Electrical stimulation Electrical stimulation was provided by a custom module that plugs into the main exoskeleton control board. As implemented, the same microcontroller that controls the joint actuator also controls the electrical stimulator. The stimulator provides a biphasic square-wave stimulation waveform. In the experiment described here, the stimulation frequency was set to a constant 50 Hz, and the pulse width set to 200 μs. As previously described, the stimulation amplitude was set by the structure of the adaptive controller. Note that, for safety purposes the stimulation amplitude was saturated at 120 mA. A pair of surface electrodes was placed on each of the right and left quadriceps. The stimulation leads were run proximally, through the waistband of the subject’s pants, where they connected with mating leads from the previously described stimulator. B.

The figure shows the across subject ensemble averaged thorax lean (sagittal thorax angle) profiles normalized to the peak value in the pre-fatigue bare condition.

However, the posture of the subjects in [Arefeen and Xiang, 2023] was highly bent-over during the squat lifts, suggesting a much lower net knee extension torque was required for their task (for which 16 Nm is a higher percentage).  A fatiguing squat study reported a 25% decline in maximal quadriceps force after fatiguing exercises [Longpr´e et al., 2015], but we did not measure maximal quadriceps forces pre- and post- fatigue in our study. If we make relatively broad assumptions of a linear relationship between EMG and force [Staudenmann et al., 2010], and consider fast LL as a maximal activity for the quadri- ceps, the 33% savings in peak quadriceps force afforded by the exoskeleton was likely sufficient to fully overcome the supposed 25% deficit in force from the induced fatigue. This could explain how the exoskeleton assistance enabled the subjects to significantly reduce their time to complete 10 LL repetitions post-fatigue by 33% and with better posture (3 degrees decrease in global tho- rax angle), see Fig. 5.5. In fact, the exoskeleton assistance practically maintained the pre-fatigue LL duration levels in post-fatigue (Fig. 5.3), suggesting a full replenishment of the post-fatigue quadriceps force deficit.

","['\nmodulated by sensory feedback (Figure 4C). For example, phase shifts in CPG activations in response to perturbations, which is called phase resetting (Figure 4C-a), have been observed in cats (Conway et al., 1987; Schomburg et al., 1998) and have been proposed to increase the robustness of human walking (Yamasaki et al., 2003; Aoi et al., 2010). However, the responses observed in the disturbance experiments considered in this study do not seem to originate from phase resetting of CPGs since they are transient responses rather than persistent phase shifts. Finally, CPGs have also been proposed to be continuously modulated by sensory feedback in many models, where the muscle responses result from more complicated CPG dynamics (Taga et al., 1991; Ogihara and Yamazaki, 2001; Hase and Yamazaki, 2002; McCrea and Rybak, 2008; Figure 4C-b). CPGs are usually modeled to consist of mutually inhibiting neurons with internal dynamics (Matsuoka, 1985), and many human walking models (Taga et al., 1991; Ogihara and Yamazaki, 2001; Hase and Yamazaki, 2002) incorporate continuous sensory feedback modulation of CPGs by adding aﬀerent signals to this internal dynamics (for example, in the form of τ ˙u = −u + other-terms + feedback, where τ is a time constant and u is the neural output). In this case, the muscle responses are likely to be slower and smaller, since the disturbance signals need to be integrated to appear in the neural outputs of the CPGs. Therefore, in order to explain both steady and reactive behaviors during human walking with control structures in which CPGs generate muscle activations, more complicated reﬂex circuits may be necessary that selectively amplify the responses not only for the whole body disturbances but also for the other disturbances.\n']","

生物膝关节在步态周期中如何通过能量传递影响髋关节的功率生成？
","['\nIn addition to the observed changes at the knee joint, walking with knee extension assistance substantially affected joint dynamics at the hip. To maintain the whole-body base of support and avoid falling forward, the increase in knee extension was coupled with an increase in extension at the hip. This was evidenced by the fact that the participants who exhibited greater improvements in knee extension also exhibited greater improvements in hip extension, and offers one possible explanation for the increase in activity for the hip extensor muscles (i.e. semitendinosus). The increased hip extension was combined with a reduction in the hip extensor moment (shift of the hip moment in the flexor direction), leading to an overall more favorable dynamic posture.  Together, the observed biomechanical changes explain the proximal shift in joint power across the lower extremity during walking with knee extension assistance. During early-mid stance, the increase in semitendino- sus activity combined with increased hip extension suggests that the hamstrings acted concentrically to improve posture and aid forward progression of the center of mass. During late stance of typical gait patterns, the hip flexors provide a propulsive force during “pull-off” and energy flows from the knee to the hip via bi-articular muscles41. While there were no changes in biological knee joint energy generation or absorption during early and late stance, mechanical energy absorption from the exoskeleton during late stance (pre-swing) likely contributed to the increase in biological hip joint energy generation. This was corroborated by the increase in rectus femoris muscle activity in terminal stance during walking with assist on compared to baseline and assist off.  Walking with knee extension assistance resulted in minimal changes in ankle function. With the foot planted on the ground, the external torque from the exoskeleton acted to rotate the thigh away from the shank, rather than the shank from the thigh, as demonstrated by the lack of change in ankle plantar-flexion angle, which likely contributed to the lack of increased energy generation at the ankle for exoskeleton assist-on while the additional inertia from the exoskeleton likely resulted in elevated energy absorption and generation during late stance at  9\n']","

混合控制器中基于阻抗模型的支撑相控制与基于运动学模型的摆动相控制是如何协同工作的？
","['\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II details the optimization process for calculating the continu- ous impedance parameter models for stance. Then in Section III, we deﬁne the hybrid controller based on this impedance model for stance and our previous kinematic model [20] for swing. We further deﬁne a new task-invariant phase variable and incline and speed estimation methods that allow the controller to operate fully autonomously. Section IV describes the experiments in which a participant with an above-knee amputation compared the controller proposed in this work with a hand-tuned FSM impedance controller. Finally, in Section V, we discuss the results, study limitations, and future work.  II. VARIABLE IMPEDANCE MODEL FOR STANCE  A. Model Framework  To use impedance control for the stance phase of the gait cycle in a continuous, phase-based control framework, we require a model analogous to the kinematic model developed in [20] that describes how the impedance parameters (K,B, and θeq) evolve during stance. Speciﬁcally, we require the impedance parameter model to be continuously parameterized by both gait phase s and task χ = (ν,γ), where task is deﬁned by the current walking speed ν and ground incline γ over the range −10 ≤ γ ≤ 10 deg and 0.8 ≤ ν ≤ 1.2 m/s.  A model that meets these criteria can be constructed from linear combinations of phase-varying polynomials, where the linear combination weights depend on task. Polynomial func- to model parameter progression tions of phase are useful during stance because they are simply parameterized and can represent arbitrary aperiodic signals. We use fourth order polynomials (d = 4), as they allow sufﬁcient ﬂexibility to model the parameter behavior without overﬁtting. Once the appropriate polynomial functions are identiﬁed for individual  2  tasks in a dataset, bilinear interpolation can be used to create a uniﬁed, continuous model with task and phase inputs  First, we deﬁne task-speciﬁc polynomial functions that represent how the parameters vary during stance for a set of ﬁxed tasks. For convenience, let sst be the stance phase (i.e., sst = s/sTO, where sTO is the phase at toe-off). Then, the impedance parameters for the p-th ﬁxed task χp are  Kχp =  d   kipsi  st, Bχp =  d   bipsi  st, θeq,χp =  d   eipsi st,  i=0  i=0  i=0\n']","

Alongside the development of exoskeletons to enhance the performance of load carriage, devices (in particular, the Lokomat17, Gait Trainer18, lower extremity powered exoskeleton (LOPES)19, active leg exoskeleton (ALEX)20,21 and Rutgers Ankle22) were designed to mechanize physical therapy for individuals re-learning to walk fol- lowing spinal-cord injury (SCI) or stroke. Common clinical practice calls for physical therapists to manually move the feet and legs of non-ambulatory patients through the motions of walking to facili- tate re-learning of movement patterns for functional improvement23.

M-BLUE外骨骼系统在测量关节角度时为何优先选择IMU而非编码器？技术依据是什么？
","['\n3.6 Human Subject Methods: Study 2  In study 2, the M-TOES controller was generalized for different joint modules, and implemented on the M-BLUE exoskeleton system. The experimental methods for validating different configurations with healthy human subjects performing multiple ADLs are presented next.  3.6.1 Hardware Implementation: Study 2  The controller was implemented on M-BLUE shown in Fig. 3.4 (see [Nesler et al., 2022] for de- tails). The unilateral knee and hip modules weigh 2.36 kg and 2.15 kg, respectively, including the battery. M-BLUE combines commercial off-the-shelf orthoses with a quasi-direct drive actuator— the T-motor AK80-9 which comprises a high-torque electric motor with an internal 9:1 planetary gearbox. This actuator is highly backdrivable with less than 0.5 Nm static backdrive torque. It can  31  Figure 3.4: M-BLUE hip-only and knee-only exoskeleton configurations worn by a healthy user (with an unpowered ankle brace in the knee-only configuration to support the mass of the knee actuator).  32  provide 9 Nm continuous torque and 18 Nm peak torque according to the manufacturer, though we verified up to 30 Nm peak torque using the Dephy FASTER ActPack driver in our own bench- top calibration [Nesler et al., 2022]. This modular exoskeleton facilitates bilateral/unilateral knee and/or hip configurations to match different use cases.  The high-level control loop ran at ∼ 200 Hz on an 8 GB RAM Raspberry Pi 4B for each leg, where bilateral configurations communicated with each other through ZeroMQ, a TCP based package. Sagittal-plane joint angles and global segment angles were measured by two 6-axis Mi- crostrain IMUs attached to the brace straps around each limb segment. The joint angles were obtained by taking the difference between the global angles of adjacent segments, which mostly bypassed the compliance between the actuator and limb segment to give more accurate joint mea- surements than the actuator encoders. In fact, soft-tissue and strap compliance caused vibrations when using the joint encoders, which was avoided by using the IMU-based joint measurements. M-BLUE was powered by a 24 V, 2 Amp-hour Kobalt powertool battery (∼ 470 g) attached to a 3D printed adapter mounted on the side of each orthosis.\n']","
M-BLUE外骨骼系统在测量关节角度时优先选择IMU而非编码器，是因为IMU能够避免执行器与肢体段之间的顺应性引起的振动，从而获得更准确的关节角度测量。文献中指出，关节角度是通过相邻肢体段的全局角度差计算得出，而这种方式绕过了执行器与肢体段之间的顺应性，因此在使用IMU时无需依赖关节编码器的高精度信号，同时避免了因编码器引起的振动问题。

On the other hand, [19] developed the embedded CV method supported by a digital signal processor (DSP) and an analog to digital converter (ADC) of 16,000 samples per second to perform high ﬁltering, feature extraction, multiplications and calculation of a max function. The work shown by [20] employed a myoelectric pattern recognition system (MPR) with low power micro-controller unit (MCU) of 32 bits with an embedded ﬂoating point unit based on ARM Cortex- M4F. The MCU was utilized to perform pattern recognition. The system developed in [21] made use of two evaluation boards, one with a 16-bit ADC and another with a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). The data processing and pattern recognition were being executed on an ARM Cortex-A8 processor.  A number of works have been done towards evaluating and comparing the computational complexity, performance, and/or power consumption of different CV algorithms on various platforms. For example, [29] studied the trade-off of speed and accuracy of different object detection algorithms; [30] tested classic CV tasks on mobile devices.

Two channels, one for the leading muscle and the other for the antagonist muscle, are commonly measured with EMG to estimate bidirectional muscle force in ﬂexion-extension. The comparison between Trial 2 and Trial 4 shows that two channels are required for bidirectional torque estimation in MMG as well. Although the raw data in Fig. 4 show no signiﬁcant difference between the results of the lead and antagonist muscles, the results of Trial 4 show that the SVR estimates muscle torque from the small difference in the lead and antagonist muscles. The difference between Trials 4 and 6 is the use of the internal and external MMG signals, which do not occur directly above the main movement muscle during ﬂexion and extension. The higher performance of Trial 6 suggests that the internal and external MMG signals contain the necessary information for knee ﬂexion-extension motion estimation.  SVR based on 2 and 4ch MMG (Trials 4, 6) showed better performance than other MMG methods, and 4 ch MMG (Trial 6) R2 did not differ signiﬁcantly from that of EMG (Trial 1) (Fig. 5).

My group’s prior work [Lv et al., 2018] developed the first version of a partial assistance controller that reduced  6  the effect of gravity on the wearer’s joints by way of a nonlinear controls technique of (potential) energy shaping. In effect it provided virtual body weight support (vBWS). Since this assistance scheme transcends the need to be pre-programmed for a particular activity/task, it is fundamentally “task-invariant”. However, vBWS does not consider body weight load distribution between the two limbs during double support phases, causing excessive assistance torques by assuming all bodyweight is supported by a single limb (single support). By utilizing the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) feedback from a custom designed force sensing foot plate, chapter 2 significantly improves the vBWS controller for double support phases, and investigates its efficacy on a single healthy subject for multiple activities of daily living (ADLs) using Comex 1. Experimental results suggest that vBWS with vGRF is an effective assistance scheme for slow activities such as getting up from a chair and performing a squat.\n']","

虚拟锚点矩阵与系绳组件的协同作用在外骨骼力传递中的功能机制是什么？
","['\n. This was accomplished via a triangulated web of inextensible elements that spanned from desired attachment points to distal and proximal areas of the body known to more readily accept higher forces. A pilot evaluation demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. Wearing the suit in a passive unpowered mode had little effect on hip, knee, and ankle joint kinematics as compared to baseline walking when not wearing the suit. We observed that when powered joint torque assistance is improperly provided, it alters gait kinematics and an undesirable increase in metabolic power occurs. However, through proper tuning of actuator timing, the exosuit becomes synergistic with the wearer resulting in kinematics that return to near baseline conditions while also simultaneously minimizing metabolic power. Specifically, we found that engaging the ankle plantatflexor actuators at 30% of the gait cycle for 250 ms resulted in gait kinematics similar to those during normal walking or walking with the unpowered suit. Furthermore, when walking with the powered exosuit with these actuation parameters, the subject’s average metabolic power was 386.7 W, almost identical to the average power when wearing no suit (381.8 W), and substantially less than walking with the unpowered suit (430.6 W). While, we did not demonstrate that the suit can make it easier to walk for the wearer, there are a number of avenues that we plan to explore to further optimize the device design. While, the actuators were designed to provide 50% assistance to the wearer, it is unlikely that this was the case due to some inherent compliance in the interface to the wearer. We plan to add sensors in series with the actuators to measure the actual forces that are transmitted to the soft suit. These data will be used to further optimize the webbing component of the interface. Additionally, for the pilot study presented here, actuation was only applied at the ankle joint and future studies could be performed to examine the effect at other joints as well as the combination of joints. Here we presented a simple timing based control scheme; however, with the addition of sensors to the virtual anchor matrix, additional human-machine interaction control modalities can be examined. Specifically, we can examine those relevant and have been shown to be very important from a physiological perspective [31]\n']","

Results All 50 participants completed gait training and assessment (Pre/Mid/Post: n = 25 for FTST and SMA; Fol: n = 19 for FTST, n = 17 for SMA), with no adverse events in either intervention group. Stepping activity data were available for 24participantsineachgroup,andTMSdatawereavailablefor 15 participants in each group (ﬁgure 1).  Clinical assessments: comparison between time points One SMA participant was excluded from the 5XSST measure for having an outlying Pre score (121.5 seconds) compared with other time points (Mid: 29.7 seconds; Post: 41.6 sec- onds; Fol: 30.1 seconds). No reason was noted for the score. However, including the participant unfairly skews the average percentage changes for this outcome, so the SMA group appears to improve considerably in 5XSST. It is unlikely that such a drastic improvement at all other time-points could be attributed to the intervention at the participant’s stage of chronicity (5.1 years).  Figure 3 illustrates the progression of clinical outcome scores at Pre, Mid, Post, and Fol for the FTST and SMA groups.

Only the SMA group exhibited changes in self-selected walking speed signiﬁcantly greater than MCID at Post. The number of participants with walking speed changes above MCIDatMid,Post,andFolwere6,14,and7inFTSTand12, 19, and 12 in SMA. Both groups had signiﬁcantly greater changes in walking endurance than MDC and MCID at Post and Fol, indicating that these improvements persist even 3 months after training. The number of participants with en- durance changes above MCID at Mid, Post, and Fol were 17, 23, and 15 in FTST and 20, 25, and 13 in SMA.\n']","

在多种任务模式（平地行走、上下坡、坐站转换、上下楼梯）中，外骨骼控制器如何根据任务需求调整助力水平？
","['\n3.3 Human Subject Methods: Study 1  The following study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan (HUM00164931). We enrolled five able-bodied human subjects (s1, male, mass: 78 kg, height: 1.78 m; s2, male, mass: 75 kg, height: 1.75 m; s3, female, mass: 50 kg, height: 1.62 m; s4, male, mass: 83 kg, height: 1.79 m; s5, female, mass: 60 kg, height: 1.75 m) to demonstrate the con- troller’s ability to assist multiple tasks. Two subjects (s4, s5) were excluded due to failure of a foot FSR causing unusual control torques, which was noticed after the experiment. The remaining sub- jects had substantial (s1), moderate (s2), or minimal (s3) experience with Comex 1. We assessed muscle activation via EMG (Delsys Inc.) of vastus medialis oblique (VMO), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (GM), and soleus (SOL), which function as a knee extensor, knee extensor/hip flexor, knee flexor, dorsiflexor, plantarflexor/knee flexor, and plantarflexor respectively.  The experiment comprised level treadmill walking at self-selected speed (1 m/s for s1-2, 0.8 m/s for s3), incline/decline treadmill walking on a ±5.2◦ slope at 0.6 m/s and a ±12.4◦ slope at 0.6 m/s, repetitive sit-stand cycles with a metronome set to 45 beats-per-minute (BPM), and stairs ascent/descent over 7 inch steps with a 60 BPM metronome. The tasks were repeated for three ex- oskeleton modes: bare (no exoskeleton), active exoskeleton with φ (PHI), and active exoskeleton  26  without φ (WOP). The level of assistance (LOA)% for the active modes was set to 60% for s1 and 50% for other subjects, based on their comfort level during practice trials. We collected at least 30 gait cycles for each treadmill task, 18 gait cycles for each stair task, and 18 sit-stand cycles. Subjects were instructed not to use the treadmill handrails except to prevent a fall (which never occurred).\n']","

Figure 9 shows the envelopes of the EMG signals measured at the vastus lateralis during a squat roughly half-way through the 5 minute series. Differences in the shapes of the envelopes for different methods can be observed. Two peaks of muscle activity can still be observed in all 4 cases, most speciﬁcally when us- ing the oscillator based control method. Differences in amplitudes are not very evident. From the view- point of the other physiological responses, half-way through the series no signiﬁcant differences should be observed.  5. Discussion  While a common task, periodic squatting can not be taken as an equivalent substitute of walking on a ﬂat terrain, because it is considerably more demanding. However, in everyday life many activities demand sim- ilar movement, for example walking up and down the stairs, which requires also dissipation of energy (nega- tive work) when going down. Another example is get- ting up from a chair. From this point of view periodic squatting can be considered as walking over a (very) rough terrain.  Our results show that using the knee exoskeleton statistically signiﬁcantly reduces the metabolic cost of squatting when an appropriate control method is ap- plied. While studies on metabolic cost when using an exoskeleton mechanism for carrying loads, e.g. (Walsh et al., 2007), or a stationary mechanism for walking (Ronsse et al., 2011), have shown an increase in the cost, come critical differences in the design of the stud-  0.04  0.06  0.1  0.08  0  0.02  0.5  0  Oscillatort[s]  2  1.5  1  0.5  0  FreeEMG[mV]  0.12  2  0  1  1.5  0.02  0.04  Position  Gravityt[s]EMG[mV]  0.08  0.06  0.1  0.12  Fig. 9.

The MMG signals closer to the targeted muscle group performed better. The 4-channel (4ch) mechanomyogram integrating A-P and M-L showed an average R2 of 0.91 for both training and test. These results suggest that the M-L MMG signal contains information that complements the A-P MMG signal.  The coefﬁcient of determination R2 of Trial 2 was signif- icantly lower (p=0.01) than that of Trial 1. In a previous study [19], the muscle torque generated during electrical stimulation was estimated using the RMS and PTP features of MMG, and a coefﬁcient of determination R2 of 0.94 was obtained for the training subset and 0.89 for the testing subset. We similarly performed SVR processing with the RMS and the coefﬁcient of PTP features of MMG in Trial 2, but determination R2 was much lower at 0.46 and 0.44 when no electrical stimulation was performed. These facts show the limitations of conventional MMG methods. The result of Trial 3 shows better performance than Trial 2 by introducing multiple MMG channels, while its coefﬁcient of determination R2 is still signiﬁcantly lower than that of Trial 1.  The MMG signal contains the acceleration of the vibration caused by the contraction of each muscle, but it also contains the superimposed acceleration caused by the motion of the limbs. The former is the main contributor to torque estimation, while the latter is the source of error. M-L 2ch is not suitable for estimating muscle contraction by itself because it contains more components of acceleration caused by limb motion than A-P 2ch, but by incorporating it into multiple regression analysis, it has the effect of contributing to the compensation of errors caused by limb motion.

在康复训练过程中，如何通过优化阻抗参数确保轨迹跟踪的安全性和有效性？
","['\nWhen calculating the repulsion force, it is possible for the 1/ρ(X,Xobs) to be equal to zero, which results in a significant change to the potential function. It leads to a significant correction of the impedance coefficient, which in turn causes the instability of the system. Consequently, the Urep(X) can be modified accordingly.  The artificial potential field method is a common algorithm in path planning, which allows the upper and lower boundaries of the channel to be set as obstacles. The optimal torque can be considered as the target. Accordingly, when the actual human- robot interaction force deviates from the optimal force, the virtual force field is adjusted accordingly. When the robot is close to an obstacle, the corresponding virtual force field is increased, while when it is far away from the obstacle, the corresponding virtual force field is decreased. Therefore, the potential function is aligned with the impedance parameters. Consequently, the impedance control parameters can be ad- justed in real-time in accordance with the potential function.  0246810  Upper BoundaryLower BoundaryOptimal Torque CurveTime(s)  10010203040 (a) Torque Coordination Channel(b) Optimal Torque CurveTime(s)  Fig. 6.

As the rehabilitation training progresses, the human-robot interaction force deviates from the optimal torque.

The positive step length SI indicated a longer intact side step length, measured by the anteroposterior distance between two calcaneus markers at intact side heel strike.  1) The control parameters (mechanics) of the robotic knee prosthesis inﬂuenced the prosthetic knee kinematics signiﬁ- cantly (p < 0.01). They elicited wide ranges of responses in peak stance ﬂexion angle, peak stance extension angle, peak swing ﬂexion angle, and peak swing extension angle. Averaged across human subjects, the respective ranges were 12.5 degrees, 15.6 degrees, 11.3 degrees and 14.8 degrees. The average standard deviation of the peak angles when using the same control parameters was 1.2 degrees across all tested control settings and subjects. The angle variations caused by parameter changes were signiﬁcantly larger than those due to the intrinsic variation of human walking with ﬁxed prosthesis control (p < 0.01).  2) A change in the robotic knee prosthesis control elicited a change in the braking impulse and propulsive impulse on both lower limbs. The braking impulse and propulsive impulse of the prosthetic limb changed in the range of 1.95 %BW · s and 1.73 %BW · s, respectively. The braking impulse and propulsive impulse of the intact limb changed in the range of 2.42 %BW · s and 1.85 %BW · s, respectively. The average standard deviation of the impulse measurements was 0.35 %BW ·s across all control settings and subjects. Note that the positive impulse was aligned with the walking direction.

Different walking speeds, foot pro- gression angles, step widths, and trunk sway angles were used as testing conditions. Subjects initially performed a 2-minute normalwalkingtrialwithaself-selectedspeed(1.16±0.04m/s), which was used as a baseline to determine foot progression angle and step width. Three foot progression angles (baseline– 15°, baseline, and baseline+15°) with three different speeds (self-selected–0.2 m/s, self-selected, and self-selected+0.2 m/s) were used in combinations to perform nine trials. In the same way, three step widths (baseline–0.054 m, baseline, and base- line+0.070 m)and trunkswayangles (4°,8°, and 12°) trialswith three different speeds were also performed.

Eight IMU data were collected with a sampling rate of 100 Hz. In their pre-processed dataset, they have provided 3D GRFs with the same number of samples as IMU and joint moments. As they have only provided KAM, KFM, and 3D GRFs, we use these variables to build our algo- rithm.

We remove those extra zeros from the shorter steps and use the rest of the dataset to build our algorithm.  B. Implementation Details\n']","

Only statistical comparisons between the optimized transition point and baseline condition are shown.  D. Effect of Sensor Signal Drop  Sensor or channel signal drop is a common phenomenon that can happen in a real-time system potentially due to the controller’s data communication failure. We have simulated this scenario to evaluate our model’s robustness in maintaining the overall classiﬁcation performance even with a certain sensor channel being disconnected. To simulate a sensor signal drop scenario, we changed the column (which represents a single channel in the sensor) value to 0. This analysis can also be representative of a feature importance analysis as the resulting performance can relate to which channel drop will cause a greater impact on the overall model accuracy.

FSMC控制器在不同地形任务（水平、上坡、下坡）下的刚度参数调节趋势体现了何种控制策略？
","['\nThe latter two trials consisted of more rapid task changes to investigate each controller’s behavior during continuous task variations rather than at steady-state and over a wider range of tasks. Further, the controllers received no real-time knowledge of the task from the treadmill during these trials, investigating the autonomous capability of each controller to operate over the task space. Both controllers utilized the same task estimation methods (Section III-B). The FSMC used the task transition logic in Figure 13b with the tuned impedance parameters at the baseline tasks from the steady-state trials. Two trials, one with inclines (CV-Incline) and the other with declines (CV-Decline), started at χ = (0 deg, 1 m/s) and explored 8 other points within the task space. Each task point was commanded to the treadmill for 20 seconds. Because the treadmill required time to change task, smooth task trajectories with continuous variations were generated, shown in Fig. 5b.  C. Experimental Results  1) FSMC Tuning Time: To produce a normal gait, the FSMC required 22 minutes of tuning by the research team: 3 minutes for the level ground baseline task, 14 for the incline baseline task, and 5 for the decline baseline task.

Specifi- cally, controllers that are trained on normative datasets may prove overly generic to cater to the unique deficits present in impaired individuals. Moreover these controllers require a secondary optimization process (e.g., reinforcement learning, human in the loop optimization) which then tries to update the algorithm by incorporating the individual’s personalized gait data. However this optimization process can take several hours of cyclical data collection and re-tuning, especially if the number of basis functions (control parameters) is large. While this may be doable for healthy individuals, it is highly burdensome and impractical for impaired individuals who usually have a small reserve of energy before fatiguing, e.g., individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) and post- polio syndrome (PPS). Moreover, the clinician (physical therapist) is completely sidelined in this methodology, preventing them from contributing their expert knowledge. Patients may also prefer their therapist’s involvement.  This chapter focuses on addressing these challenges with the novel bilateral knee controller developed in chapter 4, and the latest M-BLUE exoskeleton shown in chapter 5. First we go through the development of a clinician friendly android app (GUI) that facilitates wireless, live modification of the coefficients of the task sensitized torque bases and also displays live control torques from the exoskeleton for both legs. Next we present the individual case studies focusing on customizing the controller to suit each participant’s highly unique gait deficits, and assessing the corresponding functional and biomechanical improvements with exoskeleton assistance.  We investigated two highly impaired cases of MS and PPS. The manual muscle test (MMT) and clinician assessment of the PPS patient revealed that he had a highly impaired (atrophied) right  75\n']","

如何通过胫骨角速度信号识别步态事件中的 heel strike 和 toe off 时间点？

Schematic of shank angular velocity and gait events.  doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0171346.g003  with fourth-order, zero-phase, low-pass Butterworth filter with 10 Hz cutoff frequency [34]. Prior to the calculation of the temporal gait parameters of each trial, the reference frames of the BioStampRC and MTx were aligned using custom developed MATLAB script that employs a singular value decomposition based approach.  The projection of the shank angular velocity onto the medial-lateral axis was then analyzed  to identify the gait events based on a method described previously [20]. This algorithm has been utilized in several investigations analyzing temporal gait parameters in diverse popula- tions including MS [21, 35]. Heel strike point (HS, when the foot first touches the floor) was defined as the time point where the minimum negative peak shank angular velocity occurs immediately following the time point where the positive peak shank angular velocity occurs. This derives from the fact that the shank angular velocity reaches its highest value at the mid- swing phase and at the end of the swing phase the leg is brought to a halt by a heel strike lead- ing to a sharp negative peak of shank angular velocity [36]. Toe off point (TO, when the foot takes off) was defined as the time point where minimum negative peak occurs immediately before the positive peak [20]. Prior to the swing phase, the toe off contributes to progression with a forward push leading to negative peak of shank angular velocity [36] (See Fig 3). Once every HS and TO point was obtained, the temporal gait parameters were calculated using the following equations:  Stride timeðiÞ ¼ HSLeftði þ 1Þ  HSLeftðiÞð1  i  N  1; N: number of gait cyclesÞ  ð1Þ  Swing timeðiÞ ¼ TOLeftðiÞ  HSLeftðiÞ  ð2Þ  Step timeðiÞ ¼ HSLeftðiÞ  HSRightðiÞ  ð3Þ  For Actigraph GT3X data, the sensor recorded tri-axis acceleration at 30Hz in 6MW trials. The data was processed to count step numbers with ActiLife 6 software (Actigraph, Pensacola, FL) in one second epoch intervals (i.e. sampling window). Following the manufacturer’s guide- line [17, 37], a low frequency extension filter was used as it increases the sensitivity for detect- ing low-frequency accelerations (i.e. slow walking).

Deﬁnition of Difference in Desired and Passive Stiffness Values The diﬀerence between the desired and passive stiﬀnesses is an important index since Hypotheses 1 and 2 state that the optimal passive stiﬀness for torque tracking equals the the desired quasi- stiﬀness and torque errors are closely related to the diﬀerence between the two. In analyzing our experimental results, this value is deﬁned as the algebraic diﬀerence between the desired and passive values, i.e., Kt − Kdes.  2.6.4. Experiment Procedures The key to be able to compare the inﬂuence of passive stiﬀness on torque tracking performance under a ﬁxed desired quasi-stiﬀness is to evaluate the “best” tracking performance under each passive stiﬀness conﬁguration. We did so by experimentally evaluate the tracking errors of multiple experimental sessions, each with diﬀerent feedback control gains.

部分助力控制器如何利用下肢关节角度和地面反作用力信号实现生物拟态助力扭矩输出？
","['\nKnee orthoses must be highly versatile to handle the multi-terrain LLC that is performed in many work environments [NIOSH, 2007; Orr et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2005; Work Fit, 2023; HC Chung and MJJ Wang, 2001]. The knee joint kinetics and kinematics vastly vary between the various activities that fall under general LLC such as squatting, level walking, and stairs and ramp ascent and descent [Chan et al., 2022; Camargo et al., 2021]. Numerous knee orthoses, both passive and active, have been developed for various applications [Zhang et al., 2020]. State-of- the-art passive knee orthoses naturally fall short of the versatility required for the LLC application, as a fixed spring (even with an elaborate mechanical clutch) simply cannot recreate biomimetic assistance over a variety of tasks. Such devices have therefore been limited to supporting only squatting at best [Ranaweera et al., 2018; Hidayah et al., 2021]. Active knee orthoses on the other hand have the potential to provide versatile assistance for multi-terrain LLC. Traditionally, the development of active orthoses has favored rigid (highly geared) actuators that track predefined kinematics to assist severely impaired individuals [Zeilig et al., 2012; Harib et al., 2018]. However these orthoses are not suitable for the LLC application as the combination of rigid actuators and kinematic control hinders the voluntary motion of healthy individuals. The commercial pneumatic knee exoskeleton ROAM Forge, for example, needs to be manually turned off for dynamic gait (non-squatting) tasks since it impedes knee flexion during the swing phase [WIRED, 2021]. Only recently has there been a paradigm shift towards lightweight orthoses fitted with low-impedance (highly-backdrivable) actuators [Laschowski and McPhee, 2023], however their control strategies still lack the versatility to seamlessly support all tasks involved in multi-terrain LLC.  The overall goal of a partial assistance controller for an application like LLC is to use readily measurable signals (lower-limb segment and joint angles/velocities, foot pressure, etc.) to com- mand a biomimetic assistance torque over a wide range of tasks. A direct approach is to use inverse dynamics to estimate joint torque from measured ground reaction forces (GRFs), but this has only  53\n']","

This dataset is comprised with four locomotion modes, i.e., treadmill walking, level-ground walking, ramp ascent/descent, and stair ascent/descent. Tread- mill walking was collected for 28 different speeds ranging from 0.5 to 1.85 m/s in 0.05 m/s increments across seven trials (four speeds per trial). Level-ground walking data was collected for 30circuits–5clockwiseand5counterclockwiseforself-selected slow, normal, and fast speed, which includes both straight walking and turning. In stair walking, the subject was walking on a six-step stair-case with four different stair heights. All the subjects completed a total of 40 trials with a set of ﬁve trials starting with their instrumented leg (right leg). Four IMU sensors (thigh, shank, and foot), three electronic goniometers (hip, knee, and ankle joint), and 11 EMG sensors were attached on the instrumented leg. A set of ﬁve trials starting with their non-instrumented leg for each stair height (4 in, 5 in, 6 in, and 7 in). Sixty ramp trials were performed with six different inclination angles (5.2°, 7.8°, 9.2°, 11°, 12.4°, and 18°) with a set of ﬁve trials for each starting leg (left and right) on each inclination. Other detailed information on the protocol of the experiment is described in [42]. Dataset Pre-processing: IMU data and marker trajectory data from the motion capture system are collected at 200 Hz. GRFs data are measured at 1000 Hz, then they are re-sampled to 200 Hz to synchronize with IMU and motion capture data. Joint moment is calculated using the Opensim [12] inverse dynamics tool with motion capture and GRFs data. For level-ground, stair, and ramp walking, IMUs, joint moments, and GRFs data are segmented for a full gait cycle based on the availability of GRFs from the installed force plates on the instrumented right leg. On the other hand, data segmentation is not performed for the treadmill walking as GRFs are present for entire gait cycles. We normalize joint moment data with the body weight and height of the participants. We also normalize GRF data with the body weight of the participants.

髋关节与踝关节外骨骼在降低行走代谢成本方面的控制策略有何异同？
","['\nA common goal of human augmentation exoskeletons is to reduce the metabolic cost of walking (Ronsse et al., 2011; Mooney et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2016a; Ruiz Garate et al., 2016; Seo et al., 2016). Recent advances in the exoskeleton field have successfully reduced metabolic cost of walking in an exoskeleton below the metabolic cost of humans walking without an exoskeleton both with ankle exoskeletons (Collins et al., 2015; Mooney and Herr, 2016) and hip exoskeletons (Asbeck et al., 2015; Seo et al., 2016). The performance of these exoskeletons is a combination of both the hardware and control system. A wide variety of control systems have been proposed (Aguirre-Ollinger, 2013; Jang et al., 2015; Koller et al., 2015b; Oh et al., 2015; Takahashi et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2015; Ao et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2016) but rarely are direct comparisons made. For interested readers, recent reviews of the exoskeleton control literature are available that discuss controllers in detail (Tucker et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2015; Young and Ferris, 2017). Our study helps to bridge this gap by directly comparing control strategies on the same hardware and analyzing changes in metabolic cost.

","['\nthe model  For several of the marked comparisons, simple modiﬁcations of either the reﬂex control or the model tuning could improve the overlap. First, in the model, the rectus femoris muscle (RF) is used mainly for sensing but not actuation. As a result, it cannot change activation except during swing. In the human experiments, by contrast, RF shows response trends similar to the synergistic vasti muscle group (VAS) throughout stride, although careful interpretation of these RF responses is needed, since surface EMGs of RF, which are used in the disturbance experiments, are prone to crosstalk from VAS (Nene et al., 2004). If ﬁne wire EMG of RF reveal response trends similar to those of VAS, these trends can be reproduced by modifying the model to control RF with the same reﬂex pathways as VAS. Such modiﬁcation is tenable in the functional point of view, since RF and VAS share a common role of knee extension.  Second, the diﬀerence between human and model responses of the vasti and the gastrocnemius muscles (GAS) during late swing may be an artifact of the model tuning process, which only considered undisturbed walking. The late swing reﬂexes that control VAS and GAS in the model do not engage during undisturbed locomotion (Song and Geyer, 2015a), and thus the  March 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 15  Song and Geyer  Evaluation of Neuromechanical Walking Model  FIGURE 2 | Response trends.

集成式动作分类网络取得了怎样的分类效果？
","['\nThe task estimates are other critical components required for walking over continuously-varying tasks. Seen in Table II, the error in the speed estimate was fairly constant over the trials, with RMSE between 0.12 and 0.15 m/s for both controllers. This error is likely due to a slightly asymmetric gait, which violates the assumptions made in the speed esti- mator’s formulation. Gait asymmetries may be the result of our participant’s habitual compensations, socket comfort, or the signiﬁcant mass difference between the robotic prosthesis  9  Fig. 10.

The linearity and consistency of the trajectories illustrate the phase variable’s ability to adapt to continuous task variations and appropriately parameterize the gait cycle.  and participant’s passive prosthesis. Interestingly, the incline estimate produced lower error with the HKIC (0.67 to 0.76 deg) than the FSMC (1.52 to 3.04 deg) in both trials. We spec- ulate that the higher error in the FSMC is due to a feedback interaction between incline estimate errors and the impedance parameters. Due to the discrete switching behavior of the impedance parameters (see Fig. 13b), a small incline estimate error can result in large changes in prosthesis behavior. If this change is inappropriate for the current task, such as when γ = 1.5 but ˆγ = 3.5, the resulting progressions of θf and cop may be atypical and further skew the incline estimate. Therefore, the continuous nature of the HKIC is preferable, as it does not display step changes in behavior with small changes in task inputs.\n']","

作者指出未来需要哪些进一步的研究方向来验证脊髓控制模型？
","['\nsolely relying on indirect experimental observations can be misleading when assessing the role of reﬂexes. First, the changes in muscle responses do not necessarily indicate modulation of reﬂex gains. For example, in the TR experiment the changes in the model’s HAM and VAS responses during stance (Figure 2) result from the changes in muscle conﬁgurations while the reﬂex gains remain constant. Second, the correlation between the muscle states and muscle responses is not suﬃcient to explain the underlying muscle reﬂexes. For instance, in a gait experiment similar to the SR experiment, Yang et al. (1991) suggested velocity feedback to contribute about 45% in the generation of SOL activations during the stance phase. The suggested contribution is based on the correlation between the changes in ankle velocity and the responses in SOL activation. However, as noted by the authors of the study, this quantiﬁcation neglects the potential contributions of diﬀerent aﬀerent pathways. Performing the same correlation- based analysis in our model suggests a contribution of about 40% of velocity feedback in the stance control of SOL, even though the model uses no velocity feedback but 100% force feedback.  results also show that  Although, the ﬁndings of our study may help to construct a model that can explain the steady and reactive spinal control of human walking, it will take further research to settle the actual circuitries in humans. First, neuromechanical simulations with more physiological details will be needed to incorporate other types of experimental studies in the evaluation of control models. For instance, we would be able to compare the response amplitudes of our control model to human responses in MMR and TR experiments if our simulations could more faithfully describe the relationship between cutaneous electrical stimulation and synchronous muscle activation as well as the related neurophysiology.

The RFSEA in combination with the proposed four-bar mechanism enables Utah ExoKnee to satisfy the torque and speed objective (120 Nm, 257 deg/s) while fitting the anthropometry of the 50th percentile adult male without hardware modifications. The exoskeleton performance metrics are summarized in Table II.  C. Sensors and Embedded Electronics  Utah ExoKnee comprises an array of sensors to accurately control the human-robot interaction. An absolute magnetic rotary encoder (RM08 SD, RLS, Slovenia) placed on the actuated joint of the exoskeleton estimates the absolute knee joint position. An incremental magnetic rotary encoder (RM08 SD, RLS, Slovenia) located on the motor shaft measures its position and is used to estimate motor angular velocity. In addition, the RFSEA is equipped with a high-resolution rotary absolute encoder (Vert-X 1302, Contelec, Switzerland) that measures the deflection of the linear springs using a capstan coupling. The capstan coupling converts linear displacement due to the deflection of the springs into a proportional angular displacement of the encoder shaft, which is driven by a steel cable [24]. For the goal of this experiment, a 6-axis load cell (M3713D, Sunrise Instruments, China) is integrated into the exoskeleton shank segment to accurately measure the physical interaction between the user and the robot as necessary to assess the function of the self-aligning mechanism.

","['\nadjusts the impedance or position of the prosthetic joints based on gait phase and the users locomotor task (e.g. level walking, stair ascent and descent). The autonomous control cannot predict the user’s intent in terms of locomotor tasks and therefore cannot adapt to walking terrains. One solution is to build a neural-machine interface that predict the users intended locomotor task for prosthesis operation. Several groups have developed neural-machine interfaces (NMIs) for artiﬁcial legs to decipher neuromuscular signals (i.e. electromyographic (EMG) signals) and identify the user’s intended locomotor tasks and transitions [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. These approaches have been demonstrated to enable lower limb amputees to drive their prosthesis intuitively and switch locomotor tasks seamlessly. It has to been shown that active prostheses have the potential offer more comfort and less energy waste to the amputee compared to passive ones, [12], [13], [14]. The development of intelligent prosthetic devices has been done for a while as reported by [15]. Early investigations such as [12], [16], [17], implemented control and signal processing techniques to electromechanical systems in order to provide reliable systems that bring more comfort to the amputee. This type of research is still ongoing. Contemporary approaches make use of learning algorithms applied on exoskeletons and robotic limbs [18] with neural interfaces to the user for enhanced control, [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24] and response to human stimuli and intent, the so-called volitional control. For example, in order to give context awareness to the volitional control system for a prosthetic leg, [25] combined an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a laser distance the terrain type and slope in front meter to reconstruct of the user [25]. Lately, context awareness strategies have gained an extra resource, the use of computer vision (CV). For example, deep learning techniques have been applied to prosthetic arms in order to enhance the grasp perception, independently of object forms or size [26]. However, the requirements and constraints to upper limbs prosthetics are very different than the ones to lower limbs, speciﬁcally in terms of response time and robustness.

BioStampRC在评估多发性硬化症患者步态障碍进展方面具有什么潜在应用价值？
","['\nBioStampRC could monitor gait impairment of MS.  BioStampRC sensors detected differences in step time and stride time by disability levels in PwMS, while swing time was less distinctive between the groups. The current observation was consistent with previous researches that reported significant prolongation in step time and stride time, but not in swing time in PwMS [6, 21]. Also, corresponding to previous research [6, 19], there was no difference in the gait parameters between the control and mild MS group whereas elongated temporal gait parameters were observed as severity of gait impairment increased in PwMS. The trend was also observed in the data derived from the standard refer- ence MTx [21, 44]. Therefore, BioStampRC might be useful in identifying gait pathology in PwMS as well as in evaluating the progression of gait disability in PwMS.  Strengths and limitations of the investigation  The current study included a relatively large sample of persons with varying MS disability as well as healthy controls. Furthermore, we studied four types of clinical gait assessments that have been validated to examine gait function in PwMS [8]. Additionally, three different speed conditions were included in 6MW.  Despite the strengths of the paper, it is not without limitations. A main limitation of the study is that 6MW trials were conducted on a motorized treadmill. It is established that tread- mill walking is distinct from over ground walking. The use of treadmill and usage of the hand rail have been associated with altered gait characteristics such as increased cadence and reduced knee angle compared to over-ground walking condition [45, 46]. Additionally, a few studies have suggested that treadmill may artificially reduce the natural variability of gait pat- terns (i.e. stride-to-stride fluctuations during walking) [46]. The alternation of the gait variabil- ity has been reported to be a unique marker of gait impairment in PwMS [47]. Therefore, future research is necessary to confirm the accuracy of the novel sensor and its applications in PwMS during over-ground walking that mimics real-world walking.  The treadmill was utilized in an effort to maintain gait speed within a given trial. The well-controlled speed constraints permitted more explicit comparison of the temporal gait  PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0171346 February 8, 2017  14 / 19  Monitoringgait in MS with wearblesensors\n']","

For human subject experiments, the controllers were implemented on the Comex 1 knee-ankle exoskeleton equipped with the vGRF sensor I developed in chapter 2, which signif- icantly improved the MTOES optimization results. Study 2 generalized the MTOES framework to various modular configurations (ankle/knee/hip, unilateral/bilateral) and performed pre-clinical validation (n=8) using the MBLUE hardware on the knee and hip unilateral and bilateral modules. The primary hypothesis of both experiments was a holistic reduction in muscular effort (EMG) with exoskeleton assistance across multiple tasks.  25  3.2 Synopsis: Study 1  Study 1 utilized our prior IDA-PBC method [Lin et al., 2021] to include unactuated coordinates such as leg orientation in a passivity-based, energy-shaping controller for optimal assistance of all primary activities of daily life. In addition to global orientation, we included the vertical GRF in the basis functions (that map joint kinematics to joint moments) to address prior problems with ex- cessive torque as weight transfers from the assisted leg to the (unmodeled) contralateral leg during double support [Divekar et al., 2020]. Incorporating these additional variables increased the num- ber of candidate basis functions allowed by the IDA-PBC framework. This thereby improved the flexibility of the optimization process to fit the outputs of a single control law to normative human joint torques across all primary activities of daily life: level-ground walking, walking at variable inclines/declines, stair ascent/descent with variable step heights, and sit-to-stand. We formulated and solved this optimization problem using convex programming tools. No prior controller had demonstrated biomimetic assistance for such a wide variety of tasks without switching or adapta- tion between tasks. We assessed the muscular effort of multiple able-bodied human subjects with an experimental implementation of this task-invariant control method on a knee-ankle exoskeleton (Comex 1) to assist the primary activities of daily life (detailed below).  3.3 Human Subject Methods: Study 1\n']","

The efficacy of the controller was evaluated in an experiment on a T10 complete paraplegic, in which the controller was used at the knee joint of the powered exoskeleton in conjunction with stimulation of the quadriceps muscle group in order to perform weighted leg lifts. The control approach provided consistent tracking control, while 55% of the energy for movement was provided by the metabolic power supply through the contribution of the stimulated quadriceps.

Additional human subjects would be needed to draw more general conclusions about the controller’s effectiveness, which is left to future work.  VI. CONCLUSION This paper applied a novel energetic control strategy based IDA-PBC that can assist all primary ADLs with a back- drivable knee-ankle exoskeleton. Whereas prior work on passivity-based energy-shaping control behaved as nonlin- ear virtual springs, this paper incorporated global orientation and vGRF feedback to broaden the capabilities of the con- troller while preserving input-output passivity and stability of the closed-loop system. We increased the candidate basis functions in the optimization process, which achieved an op- timal controller that ﬁts normalized able-bodied human joint torques more closely for more tasks. We considered “L1 reg- ularization,” which ﬁts the data with as few parameters as possible to avoid overﬁtting problems. We also demonstrated the potential of the implemented controller to reduce muscular effort in a human subjects study involving level-ground, ramp, and stairs walking as well as sit-stand transitions.  Future work could consider inconsistencies between the optimization dataset and real-time GRF data from exoskele- ton sensors. Moreover, lighter backdrivable exoskeletons are being developed [11], [12] that could avoid co-contractions and/or compensations associated with exoskeleton mass, en- abling more consistent reductions in muscle activation. Future work could also incorporate the passive and active dynam- ics of the relevant muscle-tendon units to further improve biomimicry of the assistance torque.

不同踝关节外骨骼降低行走代谢成本的关键技术点是什么？
","['\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org  1  March 2017 | Volume 5 | Article 4  Young et al.  the largest contributors for providing the necessary mechanical power to sustain human walking (Sawicki and Ferris, 2009; Umberger and Rubenson, 2011), and a large number of previ- ous studies have considered how to optimize ankle exoskeletons and controllers (Ferris et al., 2005, 2006; Gordon et al., 2006; Cain et al., 2007; Gordon and Ferris, 2007; Norris et al., 2007; Sawicki and Ferris, 2008, 2009; Malcolm et al., 2009; Koller et al., 2015). Recent work has shown that a variety of different ankle exoskeletons can effectively reduce the energetic cost of walking by providing plantarflexor power at the proper time point in the gait cycle (Malcolm et al., 2013; Mooney et al., 2014; Collins et al., 2015). With the goal of making similar advances at the hip, our work focuses on a hip exoskeleton and testing its efficacy of torque delivery at the hip for both flexion and extension assis- tance. Several research groups have begun recently developing hip exoskeletons both for able-bodied assistance (Lewis and Ferris, 2011; Lenzi et al., 2013; Giovacchini et al., 2014) and for disabled populations (Arazpour et al., 2012, 2014; Buesing et al., 2015). Our study is relevant to researchers developing walking controllers for exoskeletons that include a powered hip joint or even passive designs that have targeted storage and return of energy at the hip. There is a clear need for researchers to study the biomechanics of lower limb exoskeletons to develop the most efficacious strategies of controlling exoskeletons to aid in human walking for both augmenting human performance and assisting the disabled (Ferris, 2009).\n']","

Passive orthoses, canes, and walkers cannot provide positive mechanical work to assist the most challenging activities, such as sit-to-stand and stair ascent. We examine the latest in robotic assistive technologies for common disabilities and MSDs next.  1.1.1 Stroke  Stroke is the second leading cause of acquired disability and has lasting remnant motor deficits even after extensive rehabilitation [Katan and Luft, 2018; Woolley, 2001]. Stroke rehabilitation is closely linked to the field of motor learning [Bejarano et al., 2016], which suggests that task- specific practice is superior to isolated muscle strengthening for enhancing neuroplasticity. How- ever, due to post-stroke deficits at various joints, task-specific practice is inevitably performed with various compensations, which then become habitual in the long-term [Beyaert et al., 2015]. In par- ticular, poststroke deficits at the ankle cause foot drop and reduced push-off power [Kluding et al., 2013; Verma et al., 2012], and deficits at the knee cause a locked knee gait and reduced foot clear- ance [Woolley, 2001]. A physical therapist is unable to simultaneously assist multiple joints like robot-guided training [van Kammen et al., 2020], but robotic therapies have various drawbacks. Treadmill-based robot-guided training enforces normative joint kinematics resulting in less patient effort, reduced kinematic variability, and practice on an unnatural (treadmill) surface—all factors that greatly reduce learning [Dobkin and Duncan, 2012]. While mobile exoskeletons [Buesing et al., 2015] address the last problem, their reliance on pre-defined joint patterns fails to address the first two problems. Moreover, the focus of robot-aided gait training on walking neglects the common ADLs of stair climbing and sit-to-stand, yet rehabilitation of these tasks can reduce fall risk after stroke [Amira et al., 2015; Jacobs, 2016; Morone et al., 2018]. These challenges can be addressed by backdrivable, task-invariant powered orthoses with modularity to accommodate the heterogeneity of the stroke population. In chapters 2 and 3, we perform preliminary able-bodied validation of a task-invariant controller using our first-gen knee-ankle exoskeleton (Comex 1), as a precursor to future testing on stroke participants.  1.1.2 Low back pain—lifting-lowering-carrying\n']","

参与者在不同负载条件下对K-SRDTM版本POC的用力感知评分变化说明了什么问题？
","['\nWe would assume that during a more strenuous stair climbing task, as compared to the CHFT, that the benefits of the K-SRDTM version POC would become more evident. This was not the case in the continuous stair climbing task. This test cannot be viewed as a longer version of the CHFT. In the CHFT participants ascended two steps and then descended the same two steps backwards for one cycle. In the continuous stair climbing task participants climbed consecutively 3 flights of stairs and then turned around and walked down the 3 flights of stairs facing forward. For four (4) participants, the heart rate versus time curves indicate that there does not appear to be a benefit with the K-SRDTM version POC during the 20 minutes of continuous stair climbing. This may be due to the extra physiological cost of carrying and moving the KRSD version POC down the stairs when there is no mechanical benefit imparted by the system. However, Participants 6 did show a physiological benefit with the device whereas the results of the Participant 1 are inconclusive.  One expectation of the K-SRDTM version POC system was that it would provide benefits to the user over extended periods of walking or while carrying heavy loads. Rating of perceived exertion from the CHFT partially supported this expectation. Initially, when there was no load participants rated the “with K-SRDTM version POC” condition as being more physically exerting. When the 25-lb load was added the gap between the ratings of perceived exertion became narrower. Finally, when the participants wore the 50-lb vest participants rated the “with K-SRDTM version POC” condition as less physically exerting than the “without K-SRDTM version POC” condition. This suggests that there is a perceived benefit of the K-SRDTM version POC when more weight is added. This also suggests that there is a perceived “cost” of exertion to wearing  11 - 10  RTO-MP-IST-099  UNCLASSIFIED  UNCLASSIFIED  Dermoskeleton Concept to Address the Soldiers Overload Challenge\n']","

自适应相位变量改进方法如何解决髋关节最大伸展时的相位估计暂停问题？

Second, we add states to account for thigh trajectories that have more than two monotonic sections (especially common during ramp descent) to prevent phase saturation and resulting gait desynchronization. Third, we introduce a technique to improve the linearity of ˆs, correcting for previous steady- state nonlinearities and thus making it closer to an ideal phase estimate. For brevity, the mathematical details for these improvements are presented in Appendix A.  the hip relative to the foot’s point of contact with the ground during the previous stance phase is calculated as  dst = ||xtoe − xHS−  heel ||2,  where xHS− is the value of xheel from the previous HS. Sim- heel ilarly by assuming a symmetric gait, the forward progression of the hip relative to the contrallateral foot’s ground contact point over a swing phase is approximated at each HS as  dsw = ||xheel − xTO−  toe  ||2,  To illustrate the beneﬁts of the new phase variable over its predecessor [33], [36], we conducted a simulation using thigh kinematic data from [21] (Fig. 3a). For each trial of treadmill walking in the dataset, we calculated the phase variable using both the new method (Appendix A) and the previous method described in [36]. For each incline, we averaged the phase trajectories over all strides, participants, and walking speeds, shown in Figs. 3b and 3c. Notably, the new phase variable eliminated the phase estimate pause associated with maximum hip extension that was observed with the previous phase vari- able. The new method also reduced the early saturation seen in the previous phase variable, which was particularly prominent at steep ramp declines. Finally, the new method demonstrated improved linearity, particularly during midstance. Compared to an ideal linear phase trajectory, the new method showed 4.50% RMSE with R2 = 0.991 while the previous method showed 7.48% RMSE and R2 = 0.976 over all tasks.  B. Task Estimation  In addition to the phase estimate, the HKIC requires an estimate of the user’s current task ˆχ, which is calculated at each TO during steady walking. The estimation methods below are based on [36], with modiﬁcations to improve performance. Both estimates are ﬁltered with a moving average over 3 strides to account for stride-to-stride variation.\n']","

Torques are positive in the extension direction.  74  CHAPTER 6  Customizability and Preliminary Validation of a Versatile Bilateral Knee Exoskeleton for Assisting Impaired Individuals  6.1  Introduction  Individuals with impairments present a difficult challenge for task-invariant controllers. Specifi- cally, controllers that are trained on normative datasets may prove overly generic to cater to the unique deficits present in impaired individuals. Moreover these controllers require a secondary optimization process (e.g., reinforcement learning, human in the loop optimization) which then tries to update the algorithm by incorporating the individual’s personalized gait data. However this optimization process can take several hours of cyclical data collection and re-tuning, especially if the number of basis functions (control parameters) is large. While this may be doable for healthy individuals, it is highly burdensome and impractical for impaired individuals who usually have a small reserve of energy before fatiguing, e.g., individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) and post- polio syndrome (PPS). Moreover, the clinician (physical therapist) is completely sidelined in this methodology, preventing them from contributing their expert knowledge. Patients may also prefer their therapist’s involvement.  This chapter focuses on addressing these challenges with the novel bilateral knee controller developed in chapter 4, and the latest M-BLUE exoskeleton shown in chapter 5. First we go through the development of a clinician friendly android app (GUI) that facilitates wireless, live modification of the coefficients of the task sensitized torque bases and also displays live control torques from the exoskeleton for both legs. Next we present the individual case studies focusing on customizing the controller to suit each participant’s highly unique gait deficits, and assessing the corresponding functional and biomechanical improvements with exoskeleton assistance.  We investigated two highly impaired cases of MS and PPS. The manual muscle test (MMT) and clinician assessment of the PPS patient revealed that he had a highly impaired (atrophied) right  75\n']","

The squat can be performed with varying degrees of knee flexion, such as the half squat or full squat. The half squat involves squatting down until the thighs are parallel with the ground with approximately 0–100° knee flexion. The deep squat involves squatting down as far as possible until the posterior thighs and legs make contact with each other. The half squat is typically preferred and recommended over the full squat for athletes in training or rehabilitation patients (9,28).  An exhaustive search of MEDLINE (1966 to April 2000) and SPORTDiscus (1949 to April 2000) research databases was conducted to identify scientific literature relative to the biomechanics of the dynamic squat. The search strategy employed initially involved examining all fields containing “squat” and all fields containing “squat” AND “biomechan- ics.” Because the dynamic squat is the focus of this review, all literature relative to the isometric squat was excluded from the search. In addition, only studies published in peer- reviewed scientific journals, or published as conference proceedings/abstracts from scientific conferences, were considered for inclusion in this review. From the research database searches, it was determined that barbell squat, the isotonic machine squat, and BW squat comprised the squat biomechanics literature. Most studies that examined the biomechanics of the dynamic squat have focused on knee biomechanics. Therefore, this review was limited to scien- tific studies that quantified knee biomechanics during the barbell, machine, and BW dynamic squat exercises. Dy- namic squat studies that quantified knee biomechanics have primarily focused on three major areas: 1) knee forces comprising tibiofemoral shear force, tibiofemoral compres- sive force, and patellofemoral compressive force; 2) knee muscle activity from the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gas- trocnemius; and 3) anteroposterior and mediolateral knee stability. An understanding of knee biomechanics during the squat is important because a strong and stable knee is paramount to an athlete’s success or a patient’s rehabilita- tion. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine knee forces, knee muscle activity, and knee stability during the dynamic squat exercise.  Tibiofemoral Shear and Compressive Forces\n']","

Additional human subjects would be needed to draw more general conclusions about the controller’s effectiveness, which is left to future work.  VI. CONCLUSION This paper applied a novel energetic control strategy based IDA-PBC that can assist all primary ADLs with a back- drivable knee-ankle exoskeleton. Whereas prior work on passivity-based energy-shaping control behaved as nonlin- ear virtual springs, this paper incorporated global orientation and vGRF feedback to broaden the capabilities of the con- troller while preserving input-output passivity and stability of the closed-loop system. We increased the candidate basis functions in the optimization process, which achieved an op- timal controller that ﬁts normalized able-bodied human joint torques more closely for more tasks. We considered “L1 reg- ularization,” which ﬁts the data with as few parameters as possible to avoid overﬁtting problems. We also demonstrated the potential of the implemented controller to reduce muscular effort in a human subjects study involving level-ground, ramp, and stairs walking as well as sit-stand transitions.  Future work could consider inconsistencies between the optimization dataset and real-time GRF data from exoskele- ton sensors. Moreover, lighter backdrivable exoskeletons are being developed [11], [12] that could avoid co-contractions and/or compensations associated with exoskeleton mass, en- abling more consistent reductions in muscle activation. Future work could also incorporate the passive and active dynam- ics of the relevant muscle-tendon units to further improve biomimicry of the assistance torque.

Each trial focused on a range of small task deviations (±2 deg, ±0.2 m/s) around one of three baseline tasks: χ = (0 deg, 1 m/s), χ = (5 deg, 1 m/s), and χ = (-5 deg, 1 m/s). We refer to these steady- state task trials as SS-Level, SS-Incline, and SS-Decline, respectively. For the SS-Incline trial, speed was limited to 1.1 m/s to ensure that the participant could safely perform the trial. The steady-state task trials began with an acclimation period,  where the participant walked at the baseline task until feeling comfortable. During this time, the FSMC was tuned by the research team to produce a natural gait, incorporating feedback from the participant and the prosthetist. The time taken to tune the controller was recorded. Note that no tuning was done for the HKIC. Then, the participant walked on the treadmill as it cycled through each of the 5 tasks within the small range, each commanded for 45 seconds. The acclimation, tuning, and testing procedure above was repeated for each baseline task. These baseline tasks were chosen to be far apart in the task space so that we could sample a wide range of tasks without deviating too far from any one of the FSMC’s tuning points. Fig. 5a shows the recorded task-space proﬁles from the treadmill for each trial, where the black dots indicate each commanded task. Note that both controllers were provided with true task feedback from the treadmill during these trials so that task estimate errors did not inﬂuence the results.\n']","

With this assistance, we would expect to see less stooping post-fatigue with orthotic assistance. The orthosis should also reduce muscle ef- fort to delay fatigue, allowing proper lifting biomechanics for longer periods to prevent low-back injuries in the workplace. Moreover, since quadriceps are stressed during high demand activities such as stairs and ramp climbing, the ideal orthosis should be versatile enough to provide assis- tance in multiple tasks. To address these gaps, we first designed a novel bilateral knee controller that facilitates multi-terrain lifting-lowering-carrying (LLC) in chapter 4, and later performed pre- clinical validation on eight healthy subjects using the M-BLUE bilateral knee modules in both fatiguing and non-fatiguing tasks in chapter 5.  1.1.3 Post-polio syndrome and Multiple sclerosis  Post-polio syndrome (PPS) is a neurological disorder that can affect polio survivors decades after the occurrence of the polio infection [Li Hi Shing et al., 2019].

Deﬁnition of Difference in Desired and Passive Stiffness Values The diﬀerence between the desired and passive stiﬀnesses is an important index since Hypotheses 1 and 2 state that the optimal passive stiﬀness for torque tracking equals the the desired quasi- stiﬀness and torque errors are closely related to the diﬀerence between the two. In analyzing our experimental results, this value is deﬁned as the algebraic diﬀerence between the desired and passive values, i.e., Kt − Kdes.  2.6.4. Experiment Procedures The key to be able to compare the inﬂuence of passive stiﬀness on torque tracking performance under a ﬁxed desired quasi-stiﬀness is to evaluate the “best” tracking performance under each passive stiﬀness conﬁguration. We did so by experimentally evaluate the tracking errors of multiple experimental sessions, each with diﬀerent feedback control gains.

","['\nin  the user and  B. Design and Control  The pDOFs in a self-aligning mechanism should be designed to work smoothly under the high load generated by the actuation system during assistance. The pDOFs should also be lightweight and unobtrusive, as adding significant weight or dimension to the exoskeleton may negate its assistive function [30]. The proposed design includes two pDOFs in the Sagittal  plane to compensate for vertical misalignments of the powered axis. Our design also includes one pDOF in the frontal plane to the knee accommodate for physiological variations varus/valgus angle, allowing the exoskeleton to be used on both right and left legs and by different users, without hardware modifications (Fig. 1). As a result of the proposed symmetric design (Fig. 1) of our knee exoskeleton, the reaction forces acting on the self-aligning mechanism during assistance are naturally balanced and no torsion is generated, so the pDOFs can be made lightweight. The self-aligning mechanism accounts for only 5.3% (0.190 kg) of total exoskeleton weight (3.6 kg) and all pDOFs are integrated within the exoskeleton frame. Thus, in the proposed design, the pDOFs can transmit high assistive torques, while having a minimal effect on the weight and dimensions of the powered exoskeleton.  in  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to control sit-to- stand transitions with a powered knee exoskeleton. Assistive strategies developed for individuals with spinal cord injury rely on stiff closed-loop position controllers that enforce a specified sit-to-stand trajectory without requiring active participation of the user [31]. In contrast, systems developed for healthy subjects rely on closed-loop torque control with no predefined position trajectory [32]. For example, in [33] a gaussian curve with fixed centroid and variable torque peak is used to determine the assistive torque provided by the exoskeleton, whereas electromyography is used in [34]. In our controller, the assistive torque trajectory is adapted at the beginning of the sit- to-stand movement by determining the location of the peak torque, normalized by the knee angle when the user is sitting (Fig. 5, Fig. 10). This adaptive strategy has the potential to make the assistive controller more robust to variations in user anthropometry and seat height.\n']","

This trial resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.99 between the foot sensor and force plate data (taken as gold standard), with a mean square error (MSE) of 0.03 between the two signals. Further analysis of the graph shows that the difference between the peaks in both signals is negligible, showing the linear behavior of the force sensor.  2.3.3 Experiments with Activities of Daily Living  The primary objective of the human subject experiment was to determine the effect of Comex 1 assistance torques on the muscles related to the knee and ankle joint movements during the four tested tasks. Fig. 2.5 shows the ensemble average (across repetitions) of time-normalized EMG for all muscles (VMO, BF, TA, and SOL), tasks (sit to stand, stand to sit, level walking, and stair climbing), and exoskeleton modes (bare, passive, and active). Also shown are the simultaneously recorded exoskeleton assistance torques pertaining to the muscles (knee torques are overlayed for VMO and BF, whereas ankle torques are overlayed for TA and SOL). Generally during active mode, a reduction in agonist EMG (agonist muscular activation) was observed during periods of higher torque assistance levels of the related joint compared to bare and passive modes. A detailed analysis of Fig. 2.5 is given in Section 2.4 where we dissect the EMG patterns found for the various phases of the tasks and their potential bearing on stroke rehabilitation.

为什么在康复训练和运动员训练中推荐使用半蹲而非全蹲？

The squat can be performed with varying degrees of knee flexion, such as the half squat or full squat. The half squat involves squatting down until the thighs are parallel with the ground with approximately 0–100° knee flexion. The deep squat involves squatting down as far as possible until the posterior thighs and legs make contact with each other. The half squat is typically preferred and recommended over the full squat for athletes in training or rehabilitation patients (9,28).  An exhaustive search of MEDLINE (1966 to April 2000) and SPORTDiscus (1949 to April 2000) research databases was conducted to identify scientific literature relative to the biomechanics of the dynamic squat. The search strategy employed initially involved examining all fields containing “squat” and all fields containing “squat” AND “biomechan- ics.” Because the dynamic squat is the focus of this review, all literature relative to the isometric squat was excluded from the search. In addition, only studies published in peer- reviewed scientific journals, or published as conference proceedings/abstracts from scientific conferences, were considered for inclusion in this review. From the research database searches, it was determined that barbell squat, the isotonic machine squat, and BW squat comprised the squat biomechanics literature. Most studies that examined the biomechanics of the dynamic squat have focused on knee biomechanics. Therefore, this review was limited to scien- tific studies that quantified knee biomechanics during the barbell, machine, and BW dynamic squat exercises. Dy- namic squat studies that quantified knee biomechanics have primarily focused on three major areas: 1) knee forces comprising tibiofemoral shear force, tibiofemoral compres- sive force, and patellofemoral compressive force; 2) knee muscle activity from the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gas- trocnemius; and 3) anteroposterior and mediolateral knee stability. An understanding of knee biomechanics during the squat is important because a strong and stable knee is paramount to an athlete’s success or a patient’s rehabilita- tion. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine knee forces, knee muscle activity, and knee stability during the dynamic squat exercise.  Tibiofemoral Shear and Compressive Forces\n']","
在康复训练和运动员训练中推荐使用半蹲而非全蹲，是因为半蹲的膝关节屈曲角度较小（0–100°），有助于维持膝关节稳定性；同时，半蹲便于评估膝关节的剪切力、压缩力、髌股关节负荷以及股四头肌、腘绳肌和胫骨前肌的肌电信号，因此更适合用于膝关节功能恢复和运动表现优化。

在康复训练和运动员训练中推荐使用半蹲而非全蹲，主要是因为半蹲在膝关节生物力学上更为安全，能够有效控制胫股剪切力、压缩力及髌股压力，同时保证膝关节的前后和内外稳定性。相较之下，全蹲可能带来更高的关节负荷和潜在损伤风险，因此在需要保护膝关节的训练或康复阶段，通常更推荐使用半蹲。

These have the advantage that the wearer–device interface can be implemented simply and with light weight; but, sometimes they may cause wearer discomfort owing to the transmission of uneven pressure to the wearer’s skin when applying large forces. Under this condition, a large gap between the wearer’s body and the support frame also arises, even though the wearer’s thigh/shank are tied tightly enough. To apply adequate forces to wearer’s bodies with lower clearance and less discomfort, we propose a uniform-pressure fastener. As shown in Fig. 7(c), the uniform-pressure fastener includes a link assembly in which a plurality of links are connected to wrap around the wearer’s body. A cable installed in the link assembly is conﬁgured to adjust the angle between adjacent links.  (b)  By controlling the cable tension and the moment arm length between rotating pivots and the cable paths, we can evenly disperse the interaction force. As illustrated in Fig. 7(c), the interaction force Fi acting on each link i advances toward a center point O located inside the wearer’s body, over which the fastener is mounted.

Median of the instantaneous passive stiﬀness values within the stabilized region was deﬁned as the stabilized passive stiﬀness value of the session.

Deﬁnition of Difference in Desired and Passive Stiffness Values The diﬀerence between the desired and passive stiﬀnesses is an important index since Hypotheses 1 and 2 state that the optimal passive stiﬀness for torque tracking equals the the desired quasi- stiﬀness and torque errors are closely related to the diﬀerence between the two. In analyzing our experimental results, this value is deﬁned as the algebraic diﬀerence between the desired and passive values, i.e., Kt − Kdes.  2.6.4. Experiment Procedures The key to be able to compare the inﬂuence of passive stiﬀness on torque tracking performance under a ﬁxed desired quasi-stiﬀness is to evaluate the “best” tracking performance under each passive stiﬀness conﬁguration. We did so by experimentally evaluate the tracking errors of multiple experimental sessions, each with diﬀerent feedback control gains.

外骨骼在Late Stance阶段如何根据垂直地面反作用力变化调整髋关节屈曲扭矩？
","['\n(1)  State 3—Late Stance During the third state, from approximately 35–60% of the gait cycle, the exoskeleton provided active hip flexion assistance with a supply signal linearly related to the subject’s weight on the stance leg. As the subject removed weight from the leg, the supply signal linearly decreased to 0 based on the force measurement (Eq. 2).  SupplyPressure  =  CurrentVerticalForce MaximumVerticalForce  × MaximumSupplyPressure  The output hip flexion scales linearly with vertical weight. The maximum vertical force was set at the beginning of the  (2)  Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org  4  June 2017 | Volume 5 | Article 37  Young et al.  experiment and was different based on the subject’s weight (approximately 1.2 times body weight). This force corresponds to the second peak in the vertical ground reaction force profile. The supply pressure scales linearly with applied weight. Thus, the state has a large flexion torque applied during the beginning with the rise of the second peak of vertical ground reaction force and drops off as the person takes weight off the leg and transitions into swing.  State 4—Swing The exoskeleton was unpowered in the fourth state (swing phase). The transitions in the state machine were determined by the user’s ground reaction force profile (Figure 2B). The state mac- hine controller determined stance and swing phases based on a threshold value (15% of body weight). The transition between early stance and mid stance was determined based on a 5% drop in the vertical ground reaction force signal from the first peak of the profile. The transition between mid stance and late stance was determined based on a 5% increase in the ground reaction force signal from the middle trough of the profile.\n']","

","['\n1.2 Contributions and organization of the Dissertation  In chapter 2, I improve and assess an existing task-invariant control scheme by implementing a custom foot pressure sensor for Comex 1 and perform preliminary in-vivo validation. My group’s prior work [Lv et al., 2018] developed the first version of a partial assistance controller that reduced  6  the effect of gravity on the wearer’s joints by way of a nonlinear controls technique of (potential) energy shaping. In effect it provided virtual body weight support (vBWS). Since this assistance scheme transcends the need to be pre-programmed for a particular activity/task, it is fundamentally “task-invariant”. However, vBWS does not consider body weight load distribution between the two limbs during double support phases, causing excessive assistance torques by assuming all bodyweight is supported by a single limb (single support). By utilizing the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) feedback from a custom designed force sensing foot plate, chapter 2 significantly improves the vBWS controller for double support phases, and investigates its efficacy on a single healthy subject for multiple activities of daily living (ADLs) using Comex 1. Experimental results suggest that vBWS with vGRF is an effective assistance scheme for slow activities such as getting up from a chair and performing a squat.\n']","

S-Assist中逆翻/外翻旋转轴的设计参数（角度与偏移距离）如何影响负载支撑功能的运动学一致性？
","['\nto provide 20Nm assist  torque,  IV. VALIDATION BY SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS  the performance of individual elements and of the system are evaluated by sevaral simulations and experiments.  In this section,  A. Load-Supporting Functionality with Flexibility  the We evaluated the load-supporting functionality of buckle-free frame structure. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the buckle- free structure was composed of three links (n=3) connected in series. The proximal link was ﬁxed at the experimental jig. Adjacent links were connected with two connection pins. The shape of the curved slot was based on Eqns. (8) and (9). The distance between two connection pins h was set as 20mm. The bending motion of the buckle-free structure was achieved according to the constraints between these slots and connection pins.  the kinematic dissimilarity at the ankle can induce unexpected motion deviation of all the proximal frames and joints of the device. We compared the moving trajectory of the midline of a foot for the proposed ADP ankle mechanism with that of a conventional multi-DOF exoskeleton with Matlab simulation.  During the stance phase,  Fig. 9(a) presents the kinematic model used in our sim- ulation. The black line schematically represents the midline of the foot of the wearer’s right shank. Based on average human anthropometric parameters described in [22], the in- version/eversion rotation axis of the S-Assist, expressed as the 3-D blue line, is designed to be 41◦ upward from the horizontal in the sagittal plane and 23◦ medial to the midline of the foot in the transverse plane. The joint conﬁguration for the comparison group was similar to that of BLEEX [2], which established the inversion/eversion rotation axis outside of a human wearer’s malleolus with an orthogonal revolute joint. Both the vertical distance from the foot surface and the offset distance from the midline of the foot were set to 40mm. Fig. 9(b) presents the kinematic simulation results. The red surface shows the moving trajectory of the foot midline for the S-Assist. The green surface shows the moving trajectory of the foot midline using a conventional multi-DOF ankle joint. As can be seen from the results, the trajectories match each other only when the inversion/eversion angle becomes zero. However, as the angle changes, the deviation between the two increases. At 20◦ of inversion rotation, the deviation between the two reaches 17.9mm.\n']","

M-TOES控制器在应用于LLC和受损人群时存在哪些局限性？
","['\nIn chapter 3, I show and interpret the results from a couple of human subject studies I performed as part of collaborative work to test the efficacy of more advanced, data-driven, total energy shap- ing controllers (M-TOES) implemented on Comex 1 [Lin et al., 2022] and later on the MBLUE. While the earlier study yielded promising results for one subject, the remaining two subjects did not respond consistently to the exoskeleton assistance. The latter study demonstrated the poten- tial of the MBLUE exoskeleton in reducing muscular effort for multiple tasks but this benefit was limited to only the unilateral configurations. Moreover, the bilateral knee and hip configurations demonstrated a non-significant increase in muscle effort. Moreover, the M-TOES framework does not: 1) provide guarantees on the helpfulness of the assistance torques for feedback kinematics that fall outside the training dataset, and 2) readily allow localized changes to the controller be- havior for certain tasks/task phases. These drawbacks (discussed in detail in chapter 3) made the M-TOES controller unsuitable for application to LLC and impaired populations. LLC requires a bilateral knee configuration which the M-TOES was unable to assist with, and impaired popula- tions with pathological (non-normative) kinematics require easily customizable controllers to suit their highly unique needs. These experiences motivated the development of my own clinically intuitive, bilateral knee controller (chapter 4).  In my opinion, the novel bilateral knee controller (chapter 4) and the subsequent multi-terrain LLC study in which it was implemented on MBLUE to perform pre-clinical in-vivo experiments (chapter 5) are the highlights of this dissertation. Experiments with eight healthy participants showed that the novel exoskeleton holistically assisted the quadriceps in multi-terrain LLC in both a non-fatigued state and highly-fatigued state which is critically linked with LBP incidence in  94\n']","

GuroX髋关节外骨骼在骑行任务中如何利用曲柄运动学进行控制？
","['\nOur research aimed to explore the potential of the GuroX hip exoskeleton [19] to assist with cycling despite it being originally designed to assist with walking. While previous concepts have suggested using exoskeletons during cycling for either providing assistance or as part of training regimens [20], no investigation has explored the potential for reducing cycling effort. The GuroX uses a single motor in parallel with each hip to effectively transfer torque for hip flexion and extension. While ground reaction forces are utilized to control the exoskeleton during walking, the kinematics of the crank are used for control during cycling. Cycling involves two distinct phases: (1) a pushing phase from the top dead center of the crank (TDC, crank angle 0°, 0% pedal stroke) to bottom dead center (BDC, crank angle 180°, 50% pedal stroke) and (2) a pulling phase from the BDC back to the TDC. Typically, cycling demands significant energy from major muscle groups at the hip, knee, and ankle. Research indicates that the hip contributes approximately 50% of total joint power; the knee, around 40%; and the ankle, about 10% at cadences up to 70rpm [21]. Thus, supporting hip function through an exoskeleton could offer substantial benefits. However, designing an effective assistance strategy for supporting hip extension and flexion during cycling remains an open challenge.\n']","

Using 64 cadaver knees, Klein (28) found that the MCL stretched a mean of approximately 8% of its original length, whereas the LCL stretched a mean of approximately 13% of its original length during extreme knee flexion. From these cadaveric data, Klein (28) concluded that both the LCL and MCL is sus- ceptible to injury and abnormal stretch during the deep squat. In addition, Klein (28) suggested that as the femur externally rotated during the descent, the menisci are forced to move posteriorly, causing the posterior portions of the menisci to be compressed between the tibial and femoral condyles. As the femur internally rotated at the beginning of the ascent, the posterior medial meniscus is forced toward the center of the joint space.

CPG在连续感觉反馈调制下的神经输出特性如何影响肌肉响应的速度与幅度？
","['\nmodulated by sensory feedback (Figure 4C). For example, phase shifts in CPG activations in response to perturbations, which is called phase resetting (Figure 4C-a), have been observed in cats (Conway et al., 1987; Schomburg et al., 1998) and have been proposed to increase the robustness of human walking (Yamasaki et al., 2003; Aoi et al., 2010). However, the responses observed in the disturbance experiments considered in this study do not seem to originate from phase resetting of CPGs since they are transient responses rather than persistent phase shifts. Finally, CPGs have also been proposed to be continuously modulated by sensory feedback in many models, where the muscle responses result from more complicated CPG dynamics (Taga et al., 1991; Ogihara and Yamazaki, 2001; Hase and Yamazaki, 2002; McCrea and Rybak, 2008; Figure 4C-b). CPGs are usually modeled to consist of mutually inhibiting neurons with internal dynamics (Matsuoka, 1985), and many human walking models (Taga et al., 1991; Ogihara and Yamazaki, 2001; Hase and Yamazaki, 2002) incorporate continuous sensory feedback modulation of CPGs by adding aﬀerent signals to this internal dynamics (for example, in the form of τ ˙u = −u + other-terms + feedback, where τ is a time constant and u is the neural output). In this case, the muscle responses are likely to be slower and smaller, since the disturbance signals need to be integrated to appear in the neural outputs of the CPGs. Therefore, in order to explain both steady and reactive behaviors during human walking with control structures in which CPGs generate muscle activations, more complicated reﬂex circuits may be necessary that selectively amplify the responses not only for the whole body disturbances but also for the other disturbances.\n']","
CPG在连续感觉反馈调制下的神经输出特性通过整合外部扰动信号改变其内部动态，导致肌肉响应速度减慢、幅度减小。这种调制机制使得CPG输出需要时间整合外界信息，因此肌肉响应表现出延迟性；为了适应不同扰动类型的需求，可能需要更复杂的控制回路来增强响应幅度与速度。

在连续感觉反馈调制下，CPG的神经输出特性导致肌肉响应速度减慢且幅度较小。这是因为扰动信号需经CPG内部动态积分后才影响神经输出，从而引入时间延迟并限制响应强度。为增强响应特性，可能需要引入更复杂的反射回路以选择性放大扰动响应。

First, an FSM model was designed to improve the coordination between pilots and the exoskeleton and address weight transfer problems. Secondly, a Bézier curve-based path interpolation methodwiththeextend-edgeconceptwasintroducedtogenerate the corresponding path based on the FSM and avoid foot-stair collisions. Additionally, to prevent unacceptable increases in velocity and acceleration in the joint space due to singularity problems, a time scaling and path reparameterization proto- col was designed to constrain velocity and acceleration. Both numerical simulations and real exoskeleton experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results showed that our method can assist pilots in as- cending stairs using a lower limb exoskeleton at proper joint velocity and acceleration. Furthermore, this method can reduce training challenges for pilots by simplifying weight transfer. Moreover, since our method does not require feedback data from the user’s lower limb, it has the potential to be used by people with lower limb weakness, such as those with spinal cord injuries, which would greatly beneﬁt their daily activities and independent living.

The squat can be performed with varying degrees of knee flexion, such as the half squat or full squat. The half squat involves squatting down until the thighs are parallel with the ground with approximately 0–100° knee flexion. The deep squat involves squatting down as far as possible until the posterior thighs and legs make contact with each other. The half squat is typically preferred and recommended over the full squat for athletes in training or rehabilitation patients (9,28).  An exhaustive search of MEDLINE (1966 to April 2000) and SPORTDiscus (1949 to April 2000) research databases was conducted to identify scientific literature relative to the biomechanics of the dynamic squat. The search strategy employed initially involved examining all fields containing “squat” and all fields containing “squat” AND “biomechan- ics.” Because the dynamic squat is the focus of this review, all literature relative to the isometric squat was excluded from the search. In addition, only studies published in peer- reviewed scientific journals, or published as conference proceedings/abstracts from scientific conferences, were considered for inclusion in this review. From the research database searches, it was determined that barbell squat, the isotonic machine squat, and BW squat comprised the squat biomechanics literature. Most studies that examined the biomechanics of the dynamic squat have focused on knee biomechanics. Therefore, this review was limited to scien- tific studies that quantified knee biomechanics during the barbell, machine, and BW dynamic squat exercises. Dy- namic squat studies that quantified knee biomechanics have primarily focused on three major areas: 1) knee forces comprising tibiofemoral shear force, tibiofemoral compres- sive force, and patellofemoral compressive force; 2) knee muscle activity from the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gas- trocnemius; and 3) anteroposterior and mediolateral knee stability. An understanding of knee biomechanics during the squat is important because a strong and stable knee is paramount to an athlete’s success or a patient’s rehabilita- tion. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine knee forces, knee muscle activity, and knee stability during the dynamic squat exercise.  Tibiofemoral Shear and Compressive Forces\n']","

","['\nB. Deep Convolutional Neural Network-Based Classiﬁer  DL techniques have several advantages over the conventional ML algorithms [43]. Mainly, deep and complex architectures in the neural network can have a rich feature representation that is not feasible in the traditional hand-engineered feature extrac- tion. Additionally, deep architecture is beneﬁcial for learning complex, intersubject representations that may not be possible under standard ML architectures. For CNN, we have explored different hyperparameters optimization routines. The baseline architecture of our CNN model was adopted from our previous study that utilized a CNN-based model for a robotic exoskeleton for gait phase estimation [44].

One of the two exoskeleton control boards, along with the plug-in electric stim- ulator that is typically mounted on it, is shown in Fig. 4. In order to facilitate prototyping and implementation of the cooperative controller, the embedded system in the exoskeleton is interfaced with MATLAB Real-Time Workshop via a CAN tether, such that all sensor inputs and control outputs of the exoskeleton, in- cluding stimulation channels, are assessable and controllable, respectively, from a laptop computer.

The inputs to these joint-level cooperative controllers are governed by a ﬁ- nite state machine (FSM), which is described in detail in [38].

The figure shows the across subject ensemble averaged thorax lean (sagittal thorax angle) profiles normalized to the peak value in the pre-fatigue bare condition. The prefat (pre-fatigue) plots consider the 10 LL repetitions before fatigue was declared, and similarly the postfat (post-fatigue) plots consider the 10 LL repetitions after fatigue declaration.

However, the posture of the subjects in [Arefeen and Xiang, 2023] was highly bent-over during the squat lifts, suggesting a much lower net knee extension torque was required for their task (for which 16 Nm is a higher percentage).  A fatiguing squat study reported a 25% decline in maximal quadriceps force after fatiguing exercises [Longpr´e et al., 2015], but we did not measure maximal quadriceps forces pre- and post- fatigue in our study. If we make relatively broad assumptions of a linear relationship between EMG and force [Staudenmann et al., 2010], and consider fast LL as a maximal activity for the quadri- ceps, the 33% savings in peak quadriceps force afforded by the exoskeleton was likely sufficient to fully overcome the supposed 25% deficit in force from the induced fatigue. This could explain how the exoskeleton assistance enabled the subjects to significantly reduce their time to complete 10 LL repetitions post-fatigue by 33% and with better posture (3 degrees decrease in global tho- rax angle), see Fig. 5.5. In fact, the exoskeleton assistance practically maintained the pre-fatigue LL duration levels in post-fatigue (Fig. 5.3), suggesting a full replenishment of the post-fatigue quadriceps force deficit. On the other hand, the LL durations in the bare condition increased with post-fatigue repetitions, indicating an increasing trend in fatigue.

Given the importance of inter-limb coordination mechanisms and reflexes [60]-[62], the unilateral assistance could have increased the difficulty of the task in terms of adaptation time. Although we did not record the kinematics of the subjects’ right leg, we assessed the gait symmetry through the foot pressure sensors located in the insoles. Post- hoc analysis on the duration of the gait phases did not show any statistically significant difference between free walking condition and assisted condition. In addition, we did not record the EMG signals of the users’ right-leg muscles, and the ground reaction forces. Thus we could not assess the occurrence of compensation strategies at the level of the right leg [63] during the assisted or zero-torque condition.  Further insights could be gained in the future by recording kinematics, kinetics, and EMG signals from both legs and by assisting users bilaterally. Finally, heart rate and metabolic consumption measurements would be desirable to verify possible systemic benefits to the cardiopulmonary apparatus.  C.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  Inthisletter,weproposeanoveltrajectorygenerationmethod to assist users in ascending stairs with a lower limb exoskeleton. First, an FSM model was designed to improve the coordination between pilots and the exoskeleton and address weight transfer problems. Secondly, a Bézier curve-based path interpolation methodwiththeextend-edgeconceptwasintroducedtogenerate the corresponding path based on the FSM and avoid foot-stair collisions. Additionally, to prevent unacceptable increases in velocity and acceleration in the joint space due to singularity problems, a time scaling and path reparameterization proto- col was designed to constrain velocity and acceleration. Both numerical simulations and real exoskeleton experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results showed that our method can assist pilots in as- cending stairs using a lower limb exoskeleton at proper joint velocity and acceleration. Furthermore, this method can reduce training challenges for pilots by simplifying weight transfer. Moreover, since our method does not require feedback data from the user’s lower limb, it has the potential to be used by people with lower limb weakness, such as those with spinal cord injuries, which would greatly beneﬁt their daily activities and independent living. Although our study has yielded promising results,itstillhassomelimitations.Forexample,theexperiment only included healthy individuals. Additionally, we assumed that suitable methods were used to measure the dimensions of the stairs. Our future work includes: (1) detecting environment information using suitable sensors; (2) evaluating the EMG data from more muscles to fully assess the performance of our method; (3) involving real patients in our experiment; (4) improving the system architecture to better accommodate this approach, such as reducing ankle stiffness to maintain a ﬂat foot position on the stairs during COG transfer to the front leg.

文中在不同背包载荷条件下，胫骨前肌的激活时相有何变化？其与步态周期中哪些关键事件相关？
","['\nThe ground reaction forces (kinetic data) were collected at 1200 Hz. The three-dimensional co- ordinates of makers and ground reaction forces were synchronized. The net moments at the ankle, knee and hip joints were calculated according to the methods of Vaughan et al. [20]. Then, the net muscle power at each joint was computed by multiplying the joint an- gular velocity by the local net muscle moment within each plane of movement. All kinematics and kinetic data were time-normalized to 100 points over the stride. The values for each point of interest were taken from all trials and averaged within subjects. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS software. Only the sagittal plane information was further analyzed.  For comparison with level walking data, all par- ticipants were requested to walk on a level with backpack load. Two force plates were embedded in the floor. The force plates, developed by Advanced Mechanical Technology Incorporated (AMTI), fea- ture a loading range of up to 500 N and a size of 0.51 m × 0.46 m × 0.08 m. The subject began with the condition to habituate himself to the walkway area, and then performed three walking trials under each backpack load condition with almost the same speed, during which his two feet made contact on two em- bedded force platforms separately. The subjects used their right leg for the first step, and the left leg for the second step. Before each trial, the subjects rested for 5 min for reducing fatigue effect.  2.5. Data analysis  3.

自适应阻抗控制如何根据虚拟力场调整人机交互力偏离最优力的情况？
","['\nWhen calculating the repulsion force, it is possible for the 1/ρ(X,Xobs) to be equal to zero, which results in a significant change to the potential function. It leads to a significant correction of the impedance coefficient, which in turn causes the instability of the system. Consequently, the Urep(X) can be modified accordingly.  The artificial potential field method is a common algorithm in path planning, which allows the upper and lower boundaries of the channel to be set as obstacles. The optimal torque can be considered as the target. Accordingly, when the actual human- robot interaction force deviates from the optimal force, the virtual force field is adjusted accordingly. When the robot is close to an obstacle, the corresponding virtual force field is increased, while when it is far away from the obstacle, the corresponding virtual force field is decreased. Therefore, the potential function is aligned with the impedance parameters. Consequently, the impedance control parameters can be ad- justed in real-time in accordance with the potential function.  0246810  Upper BoundaryLower BoundaryOptimal Torque CurveTime(s)  10010203040 (a) Torque Coordination Channel(b) Optimal Torque CurveTime(s)  Fig. 6.

多任务优化能量成形控制器（M-TOES）如何利用垂直地面反作用力（vGRF）实现任务不变控制？
","['\nChapter 3 presents human subject experiments that were my contributions to collaborative work on more advanced task-invariant controllers—specifically, the multi-task optimized energy shap- ing controller (M-TOES) which crucially utilizes the vGRF in its optimization scheme [Lin et al., 2022]. M-TOES was tested on 3 healthy subjects for all primary ADLs and achieved promising but subject dependent muscular effort reductions for tasks with slow as well as fast dynamics with Comex 1 (equipped with the custom vGRF sensor I developed). Next, the chapter presents the results of my latest collaboration in the experimental testing (n=8) of an updated version of the M- TOES controller implemented on our latest M-BLUE exoskeleton (knee and hip modules). Good matching between controller and normative torques was achieved with these exoskeleton/controller combinations for all ADLs. However, the vast number of non-intuitive basis functions utilized in the M-TOES controls approach hindered customizability, and possibly explains the lack of con- sistent muscular effort reductions that were achieved across tasks. These limitations precluded the application of M-TOES for LLC and impaired individuals, and paved the way for the subsequent chapters.  Chapter 4 presents a novel, versatile, clinically intuitive, and easily customizable bilateral knee controller for application to LLC and impaired individuals. Assisting LLC requires specialized torques, high in magnitude, fully exploiting the capabilities of the actuator, and not limited by the need to match the % assistance for each task or relying on a normative dataset. Although the controllers tested in chapter 3 guaranteed stability, they have no guarantee of producing help- ful torques especially for the impaired populations who have non-normative kinematics that fall grossly outside the training dataset. The critical dependence on a training dataset is also a draw- back of machine learning approaches that aim for task-invariance. In chapter 4 I took a more fundamental approach to controller development. By studying fundamental clinical gait analysis literature and using carefully selected, physically inspired torque basis functions, I developed a task-invariant bilateral knee controller which in addition to achieving good torque matching with  7  normative data, is also clinically intuitive and readily customizable.\n']","

The knee exoskeleton is essentially a standard knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO) with a powered knee module in place of a standard knee joint. The ankle joint, which is standard, is an articulated joint without compliance, but with adjustable dorsiﬂexion and plantarﬂexion range-of- motion limits. For the experiments described here, the range of motion limits were set outside of the users’ range of motion, except for Subject 3, who required plantarﬂexion limits to mitigate foot drop during swing. The primary purpose of the AFO component was to prevent the orthosis from sliding down the leg, and to offer a mounting surface for a force sensing resistor (FSR). The thigh segment of the exoskeleton is supported by bilateral uprights.

Figure 9 shows the envelopes of the EMG signals measured at the vastus lateralis during a squat roughly half-way through the 5 minute series. Differences in the shapes of the envelopes for different methods can be observed. Two peaks of muscle activity can still be observed in all 4 cases, most speciﬁcally when us- ing the oscillator based control method. Differences in amplitudes are not very evident. From the view- point of the other physiological responses, half-way through the series no signiﬁcant differences should be observed.  5. Discussion  While a common task, periodic squatting can not be taken as an equivalent substitute of walking on a ﬂat terrain, because it is considerably more demanding. However, in everyday life many activities demand sim- ilar movement, for example walking up and down the stairs, which requires also dissipation of energy (nega- tive work) when going down. Another example is get- ting up from a chair. From this point of view periodic squatting can be considered as walking over a (very) rough terrain.  Our results show that using the knee exoskeleton statistically signiﬁcantly reduces the metabolic cost of squatting when an appropriate control method is ap- plied. While studies on metabolic cost when using an exoskeleton mechanism for carrying loads, e.g. (Walsh et al., 2007), or a stationary mechanism for walking (Ronsse et al., 2011), have shown an increase in the cost, come critical differences in the design of the stud-  0.04  0.06  0.1  0.08  0  0.02  0.5  0  Oscillatort[s]  2  1.5  1  0.5  0  FreeEMG[mV]  0.12  2  0  1  1.5  0.02  0.04  Position  Gravityt[s]EMG[mV]  0.08  0.06  0.1  0.12  Fig. 9.

","['\n3.6 Human Subject Methods: Study 2  In study 2, the M-TOES controller was generalized for different joint modules, and implemented on the M-BLUE exoskeleton system. The experimental methods for validating different configurations with healthy human subjects performing multiple ADLs are presented next.  3.6.1 Hardware Implementation: Study 2  The controller was implemented on M-BLUE shown in Fig. 3.4 (see [Nesler et al., 2022] for de- tails). The unilateral knee and hip modules weigh 2.36 kg and 2.15 kg, respectively, including the battery. M-BLUE combines commercial off-the-shelf orthoses with a quasi-direct drive actuator— the T-motor AK80-9 which comprises a high-torque electric motor with an internal 9:1 planetary gearbox. This actuator is highly backdrivable with less than 0.5 Nm static backdrive torque. It can  31  Figure 3.4: M-BLUE hip-only and knee-only exoskeleton configurations worn by a healthy user (with an unpowered ankle brace in the knee-only configuration to support the mass of the knee actuator).  32  provide 9 Nm continuous torque and 18 Nm peak torque according to the manufacturer, though we verified up to 30 Nm peak torque using the Dephy FASTER ActPack driver in our own bench- top calibration [Nesler et al., 2022]. This modular exoskeleton facilitates bilateral/unilateral knee and/or hip configurations to match different use cases.  The high-level control loop ran at ∼ 200 Hz on an 8 GB RAM Raspberry Pi 4B for each leg, where bilateral configurations communicated with each other through ZeroMQ, a TCP based package. Sagittal-plane joint angles and global segment angles were measured by two 6-axis Mi- crostrain IMUs attached to the brace straps around each limb segment. The joint angles were obtained by taking the difference between the global angles of adjacent segments, which mostly bypassed the compliance between the actuator and limb segment to give more accurate joint mea- surements than the actuator encoders. In fact, soft-tissue and strap compliance caused vibrations when using the joint encoders, which was avoided by using the IMU-based joint measurements. M-BLUE was powered by a 24 V, 2 Amp-hour Kobalt powertool battery (∼ 470 g) attached to a 3D printed adapter mounted on the side of each orthosis.\n']","
M-BLUE外骨骼系统在测量关节角度时优先选择IMU而非编码器，是因为IMU能够绕过执行器与肢体段之间的顺应性，避免由软组织和带扣造成的振动干扰，从而提供更稳定、准确的运动学测量；而编码器受限于机械结构与执行器输出，难以有效消除这些误差，导致测量不精确。IMU具备更高的抗干扰能力，适合动态运动环境下的高精度角度测量。

    M-BLUE外骨骼系统优先选择IMU而非编码器测量关节角度，主要技术依据在于：IMU通过测量相邻肢体段的全局角度差，绕过了执行器与肢体之间的柔顺性，提升了测量准确性；同时，编码器因软组织与绑带柔顺性引发振动，影响稳定性，而IMU方式可有效避免该问题。

优化过程中被忽略的参数标准是什么，其背后的工程意义是什么？
","['\nWe optimize the constant coefﬁcients α to ﬁt the control law outputs to normalized values of the across-subject (ten sub- jects) averaged human joint torques over level-ground, ramps, stairs walking [33], and stand-to-sit [35]. The optimization process provides the optimal parameters α∗, where we neglect those parameters with absolute values contributing less than 0.1% · α∗2. The vGRFs during locomotion tasks in [33] are normalized by the body weight. Because the stand-to-sit data in [35] does not provide vGRFs, we set the vGRF to a constant value during the optimization process (a reason- able assumption for a quasi-static task like stand-to-sit). The training tasks include level treadmill walking at 0.5,1.5m/s, ascending/descending ramps with inclines of 5.2◦,11◦, as- cending/descending stairs with step height of 4,7inch [33], and the stand-to-sit task in [35]. The original knee torque data  VOLUME 1, 2022  in [35] was not adequate during the late stand-to-sit cycle because of support from the chair during data collection. To provide adequate support with our controller, we modiﬁed the able-bodied knee torque proﬁle from [35] by holding the peak knee torque from 60% to 100% of the cycle.  Fig. 3 shows the simulated exoskeleton control torques and demonstrates the agreement between a single energy-shaping control strategy (exoskeleton torque τexo) and normalized able-bodied human torques τhum over the training activities. The validation activities are considered next in comparison with a state-of-art ﬁnite state machine (FSM) controller [5].  B. COMPARISON TO IDEAL FINITE STATE MACHINE The presented method was evaluated by comparison with an ideal FSM for testing tasks. We deﬁned the FSM in a similar way as in [36], where the ideal FSM was assumed to provide the normalized able-bodied human torque with pre-deﬁned tasks using intent recognition between different modes, including walking and stairs climbing. The pre- deﬁned “training” tasks included level treadmill walking at 1.5 m/s, ramp ascent/descent at 5.2◦, and stairs ascent/descent with 4inch step height in [33] to cover a similar number of tasks to a state-of-art FSM [5]. The ideal FSM returns the pre-deﬁned torque proﬁleYj, j ∈ {1,...,5}, that most closely matches the normalized able-bodied proﬁle Yi for the current task i. The problem is deﬁned in [36, 7] as ﬁnding j in the pre-deﬁned tasks via  argmin  j   Yi,ankle −Yj,ankle    2  +   Yi,knee −Yj,knee    2\n']","

自适应阻抗控制中如何利用运动学信号和足底开关数据实现步态事件的准确识别？

Experimental protocol Three able-bodied subjects (1 male, 2 female; 24-28 years, 163-184 cm, 54-75 kg) gave informed consent and completed the experiment, which was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board. Each subject completed at least 10 repetitions of a locomotion circuit consisting of walking on level ground, ascending/descending a ramp with a 10° slope, and ascending/descending a 3-step staircase in an experimental session. The true locomotor intent of the subject was labeled by the experimenter using a key fob to provide supervised data to train an intent recognition algorithm. Bilateral electromyographic (EMG) signals were collected using bipolar surface electrodes (model DE2.1; Delsys, Boston, MA, USA) from the same 6 muscles in each leg: tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), soleus (SOL), vastus medialis (VM), rectus femoris (RF), and semitendinosus (ST) (Fig. 1). These muscles are a subset of the uniarticular and biarticular muscles about the ankle, knee, and hip. Electrode placement was guided by the SENIAM standards and verified by having subjects perform voluntary contractions. Signals were amplified by 1000x, filtered between 20-450 Hz (Bagnoli 16, Delsys), and sampled at 1 kHz. Bilateral kinematic signals were recorded using biaxial goniometers (Biometrics Ltd, Newport, UK) placed on the knee and ankle and sampled at 500 Hz (Fig. 1). Flexible event switches (MA-153; Motion Lab Systems, Baton Rouge, LA, USA) were taped bilaterally to the subjects’ feet beneath the heel and first metatarsal (Fig. 1). Footswitch data were sampled at 500 Hz using a custom data acquisition unit and used to detect heel contact and toe off gait events. All signals were simultaneously recorded using a custom 16-bit analog-to-digital converter that permits multi-rate sampling.\n']","

The squat can be performed with varying degrees of knee flexion, such as the half squat or full squat. The half squat involves squatting down until the thighs are parallel with the ground with approximately 0–100° knee flexion. The deep squat involves squatting down as far as possible until the posterior thighs and legs make contact with each other. The half squat is typically preferred and recommended over the full squat for athletes in training or rehabilitation patients (9,28).  An exhaustive search of MEDLINE (1966 to April 2000) and SPORTDiscus (1949 to April 2000) research databases was conducted to identify scientific literature relative to the biomechanics of the dynamic squat. The search strategy employed initially involved examining all fields containing “squat” and all fields containing “squat” AND “biomechan- ics.” Because the dynamic squat is the focus of this review, all literature relative to the isometric squat was excluded from the search. In addition, only studies published in peer- reviewed scientific journals, or published as conference proceedings/abstracts from scientific conferences, were considered for inclusion in this review. From the research database searches, it was determined that barbell squat, the isotonic machine squat, and BW squat comprised the squat biomechanics literature. Most studies that examined the biomechanics of the dynamic squat have focused on knee biomechanics. Therefore, this review was limited to scien- tific studies that quantified knee biomechanics during the barbell, machine, and BW dynamic squat exercises. Dy- namic squat studies that quantified knee biomechanics have primarily focused on three major areas: 1) knee forces comprising tibiofemoral shear force, tibiofemoral compres- sive force, and patellofemoral compressive force; 2) knee muscle activity from the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gas- trocnemius; and 3) anteroposterior and mediolateral knee stability. An understanding of knee biomechanics during the squat is important because a strong and stable knee is paramount to an athlete’s success or a patient’s rehabilita- tion. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to examine knee forces, knee muscle activity, and knee stability during the dynamic squat exercise.  Tibiofemoral Shear and Compressive Forces\n']","

Controllers that vary knee swing speed have been shown to restore gait symmetry with a powered knee and ankle prosthesis. This study  was to combine an existing variable speed knee swing controller with an existing impedance stance controller to determine if comfortable walking with variable cadence can be achieved and if the control method transitions would be noticeable to the user. The knee swing trajectory and duration was varied based on user walking speed as a function of the previous stance phase duration. Four transfemoral amputations were fit with a powered knee and ankle prosthesis. After 3045 minutes of practice walking with the variable knee swing controller, subjects performed a variable speed walk test, a steady state walk test, and a 10-meter walk test. A GAITRite mat was used to collect spatial and temporal walking parameters during the 10-meter walk test. Results showed that subjects could control prosthetic knee swing duration and kinematics by modifying their walking speed. Subjects were able to comfortably transition between speeds and achieve mean (SD) comfortable and fast speeds of 1.10 (0.05) and 1.51 (0.05) m\/s, respectively for a 10-meter walk test.  contribution is to show that a variable speed knee controller can be combined with an impedance-based controller while maintaining the functionality of both controllers and to provide gait mechanics for amputee powered gait that can be used towards future studies of controller development and prosthesis design.  individuals with unilateral  I.

Bryan, Jennifer L. Hicks, Scott L. Delp, Steven H. Collins, IEEE Member  Abstract—While exoskeletons have markedly reduced the metabolic cost of walking, exoskeleton design remains expensive and time-consuming. Biomechanical simulations could improve exoskeleton development with their ability to optimize many design and control parameters simultaneously. While promis- ing, simulations often rely on simplifying assumptions, such as ﬁxed kinematic methods. Furthermore, few simulation-based designs have been tested directly in human experiments. To evaluate the utility of simulations for exoskeleton design, we designed a controller using biomechanical simulation and then tested the controller with a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton worn by a single experienced user. Here we show that a biomechanical simulation constrained by safe, experiment-based torque limits can ﬁnd an assistance pattern that reduces metabolic cost but with substantial differences between expected and measured outcomes. We found a simulated assistance proﬁle that was expected to reduce the metabolic cost of walking by 69.0%. When tested experimentally, it reduced the cost by 25.9% compared to walking in the device unassisted. The simulation predicted the direction of activity change in most muscles but overestimated the total magnitude of these changes. The applied torques resulted in joint kinematic and stride frequency changes that were not accounted for in the simulation. Future simulations could allow kinematic adaptations and use updated cost functions that better reﬂect how humans respond to assistance. Continued feedback between experimental testing and simulation design will build on these promising results to improve the accuracy of simulations and enhance their ability to guide future exoskeleton designs.  I. INTRODUCTION  Instead of relying on biomimicry, intuition, and hand-tuning, this technique uses measurements of the exoskeleton user to update the control of the exoskeleton to minimize a cost function. This approach has led to some of the largest reductions in metabolic cost to date [2], [3].","id":"f69a7b9c-0d87-44b1-8e8a-dfa4b37feb48"}

Gregg  Abstract—Most impedance-based walking controllers use a ﬁ- nite state machine (FSM) with dozens of user-speciﬁc parameters that need to be manually tuned by technical experts. These parameters are only optimal near the task (e.g., walking speed and incline) at which they were tuned, resulting in decreased per- formance as task inevitably varies. This paper presents a tuning- free, phase-based controller that uses a hybrid combination of continuously-variable impedance control during stance and kine- matic control during swing to enable biomimetic locomotion over a continuum of tasks. After generating a data-driven model of variable joint impedance with convex optimization, we implement a novel task-invariant phase variable and real-time estimates of speed and incline to enable the controller to autonomously adapt to task variation. Experiments with an amputee participant using a powered knee-ankle prosthesis show that our tuning- free controller 1) features highly-linear phase estimates and accurate task estimates, 2) produces more biomimetic joint work trends compared to a hand-tuned FSM impedance controller, and 3) achieves lower kinematic and kinetic error than the FSM impedance controller in 7 of 8 tested metrics.

This study presents an exoskeleton that boosts vertical jumping—a fast, short movement during which the muscles are exerted at peak capacity. It was hypothesized that a passive exoskeleton would increase vertical jump height without requiring exter- nal energy input. The device comprises springs that work in parallel with the muscles of the quadriceps femoris. The springs store mechanical energy during knee ﬂexion (the negative work phase) and release that energy during the subsequent knee extension (the positive work phase), augmenting the muscles. Ten healthy participants were evaluatedin two experimental sessions. In the ﬁrst session, the participants jumped without receiving instructions on how to use the exoskeleton, and the results showed no dif- ference in jump height when jumping with the exoskeleton orjumpingwithoutit.Inthesecondsession,theparticipants were instructedto achievedeeperinitialsquatheightsat the start of the jump. This resultedin a 6.4% increasein average jump height compared to jumping without the exoskeleton (each participant performed ﬁve jumps for each the two conditions).

The typical weight burden often exceeds 40 kg which is beyond the recommended maximum load limits which lead to acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of a new device called “Dermoskeleton” designed to counterpart the acute and chronic impacts of the distributed overload bearing of dismounted soldiers in all their tasks, e.g. marching and fighting modes. The performance of the initial prototypes was evaluated experimentally using standardized quantitative aerobic and anaerobic tests. The evaluation protocol included two conditions (with and without the device), with three weight criteria (no weight, 25 lbs, 50 lbs), and three (3) short\/intense exercises tests: 1) performing the maximum amount of squats possible, 2) continuously climbing 3 flights of stairs for a period of 20 minutes and 3) conducting the Canadian Home Fitness Test (CHFT). The results showed a significant mechanical advantage (i.e. 48%) during the squat test. The current proof-of-concept prototype did not show a physiological benefit for stair climbing tasks but for one (1) participant. During the CHFT, the physiological effort with the device raised at about 5% to 10%. However, the participants perceived less physically exerting while loaded when using the dermoskeleton. The participants also noted that the system had considerable potential to enhance soldier mobility and reduce musculo-skeletal demands if key attributes of the system could be improved.  1.0 INTRODUCTION  1.1 The Challenge","id":"187abd90-7531-48a2-a6e8-4424786e6898"}

Kuo, J. Maxwell Donelan  A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deﬁcits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deﬁcits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies.

Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the virtual anchor technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best accept load. Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit’s performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated the effect of the ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer’s hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking. Wearing the suit in a passive unpowered mode had little effect on hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics as compared to baseline walking when not wearing the suit. Engaging the actuators at the ankles at 30% of the gait cycle for 250 ms altered joint kinematics the least and also minimized metabolic power. The subject’s average metabolic power was 386.7 W, almost identical to the average power when wearing no suit (381.8 W), and substantially less than walking with the unpowered suit (430.6 W). This preliminary work demonstrates that the exosuit can comfortably transmit joint torques to the user while not restricting mobility and that with further optimization, has the potential to reduce the wearer’s metabolic cost during walking. I. INTRODUCTION Over the last two decades, a number of exoskeletons have been developed for tasks ranging from heavy lifting [1] to helping the wearer to walk [2-6] and for providing robotic rehabilitation therapy in a hospital setting [7]. Recently, with improvements in actuator and sensor technology we have seen these systems become portable, and begin to transition from academic to commercial applications.

Panizzolo1,2, Ignacio Galiana1,2, Alan T. Asbeck1,2, Christopher Siviy1,2, Kai Schmidt1,2, Kenneth G. Holt3 and Conor J. Walsh1,2*  Abstract  Background: Carrying load alters normal walking, imposes additional stress to the musculoskeletal system, and results in an increase in energy consumption and a consequent earlier onset of fatigue. This phenomenon is largely due to increased work requirements in lower extremity joints, in turn requiring higher muscle activation. The aim of this work was to assess the biomechanical and physiological effects of a multi-joint soft exosuit that applies assistive torques to the biological hip and ankle joints during loaded walking. Methods: The exosuit was evaluated under three conditions: powered (EXO_ON), unpowered (EXO_OFF) and unpowered removing the equivalent mass of the device (EXO_OFF_EMR). Seven participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill and carried a load equivalent to 30 % their body mass. We assessed their metabolic cost of walking, kinetics, kinematics, and lower limb muscle activation using a portable gas analysis system, motion capture system, and surface electromyography.  Results: Our results showed that the exosuit could deliver controlled forces to a wearer. Net metabolic power in the EXO_ON condition (7.5 ± 0.6 W kg−1) was 7.3 ± 5.0 % and 14.2 ± 6.1 % lower than in the EXO_OFF_EMR condition (7.9 ± 0.8 W kg−1; p = 0.027) and in the EXO_OFF condition (8.5 ± 0.9 W kg−1; p = 0.005), respectively. The exosuit also reduced the total joint positive biological work (sum of hip, knee and ankle) when comparing the EXO_ON condition (1.06 ± 0.16 J kg−1) with respect to the EXO_OFF condition (1.28 ± 0.26 J kg−1; p = 0.020) and to the EXO_OFF_EMR condition (1.22 ± 0.21 J kg−1; p = 0.007). Conclusions: The results of the present work demonstrate for the first time that a soft wearable robot can improve walking economy. These findings pave the way for future assistive devices that may enhance or restore gait in other applications.

Compared with the popular deep learning structures, such as deep neural networks, BLS has the ability of rapid incremental learning and can remodel the system without the usual tedious retraining process. However, given that BLS is still in its infancy, it still needs analysis, improvements, and veriﬁcation. In this article, we ﬁrst analyze the principle of fast incremental learning ability of BLS in depth. Second, in order to provide an in-depth analysis of the BLS structure, according to the novel structure design concept of deep neural networks, we present four brand-new BLS variant networks and their incremental realizations. Third, based on our analysis of the effect of feature nodes and enhancement nodes, a new BLS structure with a semantic feature extraction layer has been proposed, which is called SFEBLS.

The next stage of development in wearable robotics requires expanding studies ‘under the skin’ and ‘out into the world’. Developing animal models to explore locomotion with wearable robotics could offer the opportunity to answer questions up and down the broader spatiotemporal scale that are not currently possible in humans. To fill this gap, we have built the first ever wearable robotic device for a freely-locomoting, non-human, bipedal animal (Numida melaegris = Guinea fowl), a species whose gait closely mirror human locomotion mechanics. We found that a passive soft-exosuit design that parallels current human passive-elastic ankle exoskeletons in function was both well tolerated and provided consistent torques. Preliminary data showed birds systematically change their kinematics in response to changes to exo-suit spring stiffness, adjusting the timing but not magnitude of the assistive torques.

A representative dataset for training data-driven models is crucial to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. However, the acquisition of sufﬁcient data is time-consuming and often infeasible. We present a method to create realistic inertial sensor data with corresponding biomechanical variables by 2D walking and running simulations. We augmented a measured inertial sensor dataset with simulated data for the training of convolutional neural networks to estimate sagittal plane joint angles, joint moments, and ground reaction forces (GRFs) of walking and running. When adding simulated data, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the test set of hip, knee, and ankle joint angles decreased up to 17%, 27% and 23%, the RMSE of knee and ankle joint moments up to 6% and the RMSE of anterior-posterior and vertical GRF up to 2and 6%. Simulation-aided estimation of joint moments and GRFs was limited by inaccuracies of the biomechanical model. Improving the physics-based model and domain adaptation learning may further increase the beneﬁt of simulated data. Future work can exploit biomechanical simulations to connect different data sources in order to create representative datasets of human movement. In conclusion, machine learning can beneﬁt from available domain knowledge on biomechanical simulations to supplement cumbersome data collections.

Rouse1,2*  User preference is a promising objective for the control of robotic exoskeletons because it may capture the multi- factorial nature of exoskeleton use. However, to use it, we must first understand its characteristics in the context of exoskeleton control. Here, we systematically measured the control preferences of individuals wearing bilateral ankle exoskeletons during walking. We investigated users’ repeatability identifying their preferences and how preference changes with walking speed, device exposure, and between individuals with different technical back- grounds. Twelve naive and 12 knowledgeable nondisabled participants identified their preferred assistance in repeated trials by simultaneously self-tuning the magnitude and timing of peak torque. They were blinded to the control parameters and relied solely on their perception of the assistance to guide their tuning. We found that participants’ preferences ranged from 7.9 to 19.4 newton-meters and 54.1 to 59.2 percent of the gait cycle. Across trials, participants repeatably identified their preferences with a mean standard deviation of 1.7 newton-meters and 1.5 percent of the gait cycle. Within a trial, participants converged on their preference in 105 seconds. As the experiment progressed, naive users preferred higher torque magnitude. At faster walking speeds, these individuals were more precise at identifying the magnitude of their preferred assistance. Knowledgeable users preferred higher torque than naive users. These results highlight that although preference is a dynamic quantity, individuals can reliably identify their preferences. This work motivates strategies for the control of lower limb exoskeletons in which individuals customize assistance according to their unique preferences and provides meaningful insight into how users interact with exoskeletons.","id":"2ffb475d-4769-4e52-b545-50d6ae6b05b2"}

Stair Ascent Phase-Variable Control of a Powered Knee-Ankle Prosthesis  Ross J. Cortino,  Edgar Bolívar-Nieto,  T. Kevin Best,  Robert D. Gregg  Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Robotics Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.  Abstract  Passive prostheses cannot provide the net positive work required at the knee and ankle for step- over stair ascent. Powered prostheses can provide this net positive work, but user synchronization of joint motion and power input are critical to enabling natural stair ascent gaits. In this work, we build on previous phase variable-based control methods for walking and propose a stair ascent controller driven by the motion of the user’s residual thigh. We use reference kinematics from an able-bodied dataset to produce knee and ankle joint trajectories parameterized by gait phase. We redefine the gait cycle to begin at the point of maximum hip flexion instead of heel strike to improve the phase estimate. Able-bodied bypass adapter experiments demonstrate that the phase variable controller replicates normative able-bodied kinematic trajectories with a root mean squared error of 12.66° and 2.64° for the knee and ankle, respectively. The knee and ankle joints provided on average 0.39 J\/kg and 0.21 J\/kg per stride, compared to the normative averages of 0.34 J\/kg and 0.21 J\/kg, respectively. Thus, this controller allows powered knee-ankle prostheses to perform net positive mechanical work to assist stair ascent.  I.  Introduction","id":"0517a12c-3f9d-4182-bbcb-ba68cbaf6001"}

Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy.

Scherpereel*, Dean D. Molinaro, Max K. Shepherd, Omer T. Inan, and Aaron J. Young  Abstract— Objective: Real-time measurement of biological joint moment could enhance clinical assessments and generalize exoskeleton control. Accessing joint moments outside clinical and laboratory settings requires harnessing non-invasive wearable sensor data for indirect estimation. Previous approaches have been primarily validated during cyclic tasks, such as walking, but these methods are likely limited when translating to non-cyclic tasks where the mapping from kinematics to moments is not unique. Methods: We trained deep learning models to estimate hip and sensors, electromyography (EMG), and simulated pressure insoles from a dataset including 10 cyclic and 18 non-cyclic activities. We assessed estimation error on combinations of sensor modalities during both activity types. Results: Compared to the kinematics- only baseline, adding EMG reduced RMSE by 16.9% at the hip and 30.4% at the knee (p<0.05) and adding insoles reduced RMSE by 21.7% at the hip and 33.9% at the knee (p<0.05). Adding both modalities reduced RMSE by 32.5% at the hip and 41.2% at the knee (p<0.05) which was significantly higher than either modality individually (p<0.05). All sensor additions improved model performance on non-cyclic tasks more than cyclic tasks (p<0.05). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that adding kinetic sensor information through EMG or insoles improves joint moment estimation both individually and jointly. These additional modalities are most important during non-cyclic tasks, tasks that reflect the variable and sporadic nature of the real-world.

In this study, we sought to simultaneously and independently assess patient and prosthetist preference for prosthetic foot stiffness using a custom variable-stiffness prosthesis. In the first part of the experiment, seven subjects with below-knee amputation walked on the variable-stiffness prosthetic foot set to a randomized stiffness, while several prosthetist subjects simultaneously observed their gait. After each trial, the amputee subjects and prosthetist subjects indicated the change to stiffness that they would prefer (increase or decrease). this paradigm allowed us to simultaneously measure amputee subject and prosthetist subject preferences, and provided a reliability index indicating the consistency of their preferences. In the second part of the experiment, amputee subjects were instructed to communicate verbally with one prosthetist subject to arrive at a mutually preferred stiffness. On average, prosthetist subjects preferred a 26% higher stiffness than amputee subjects (p < 0.001), though this depended on the amputee subject (p < 0.001). Prosthetist subjects were also considerably less consistent than amputee subjects in their preferences (CV of 5.6% for amputee subjects, CV of 23% for prosthetist subjects; p = 0.014).

It has been shown that they are capable of attaining improved temporal and propulsive symmetry when walking with a powered knee prosthesis and visual feedback, but they perceive this pattern of gait to be more difficult. Rather than improving the efficiency of gait, improved gait symmetry may be increasing individuals’ effort associated with maintaining lateral balance. Methods: In this study, we used a simple visual feedback paradigm to increase the prosthesis-side stance time of six individuals with unilateral TFA or KD as they walked on a powered knee prosthesis at their self-selected speed. As they walked more symmetrically, we evaluated changes in medial-lateral center-of-mass excursion, lateral margin of stability, stride width, and hip abductor activity. Results: As the subjects increased their prosthesis-side stance time, their center-of-mass excursion and hip abductor activity significantly increased, while their lateral margin of stability significantly decreased on the prosthesis-side only. Stride width remained relatively unchanged with testing condition. Conclusions: Extended stance time on a powered knee prosthesis (yielding more symmetric gait) challenged the lateral balance of individuals with lower limb amputation. Lateral stability may be a reason they prefer an asymmetric gait, even with more advanced technology. Hip muscular changes post-amputation may contribute to the decline in stability on the prosthesis side. Interventions and advancements in prosthesis control aimed at improving their control of lateral balance may ameliorate the difficulty in walking with improved gait symmetry.

Assisting hip extension with a tethered exosuit and a simulation-optimized force profile reduces metabolic cost of running.  Through evolution, our human species has become remarkably good at distance running thanks to long spring-like tendons in the legs and hairless skin for optimal thermoregulation. Studies have shown that distance running per- formance is linearly correlated with metabolic cost, and there has been an increased interest in the robotics community to develop wear- able exoskeletons to further augment human performance by reducing metabolic cost.  The past 3 years have seen exciting break- throughs in exoskeletons that are able to reduce the metabolic cost of walking (1–4); however, to date, efforts to develop exoskel- etons that assist running have been limited, and initial studies have not yet been able to dem - onstrate reductions in metabolic cost (5, 6). One of the challenges with developing exo- skeletons to assist running is that biological joint work in running is greater than in walk- ing. Another challenge is that the metabolic cost of carrying weight at the waist or distal- ly is higher during running than during walk- ing; therefore, the metabolic penalty of the weight of an exoskeleton is more likely to offset the effects of the assistance.  Due to limited studies on assisted running, we do not yet know which joint is best in as- sisting and which moment profile is optimal. A common thought in the field of exoskele- ton research over the previous decade is that assistance profiles should mimic the biolog- ical moments. However, in recent studies on walking, it has been demonstrated that higher reductions in metabolic cost can be achieved by exploring the metabolic landscape of the wearer by conducting parameter sweeps to identify the optimal actuation profiles (1, 2, 7, 8).

Engaging and disengaging clutches ap- propriately could reduce electrical energy consumption without sacriﬁcing controllability, but presents a challenging control problem. We formulated the optimal control objective of minimizing actuator power consumption as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) and solved for the global minimum. For a given actuator design and a wide range of simulated torque and rotation patterns, all corresponding to zero net work over one cycle, we compared optimized actuator energy consumption to that of an optimized gear motor with simple parallel elasticity. The simulated energy-recycling actuator con- sumed less electrical energy: 57% less on average and 80% less in the best case.

In humans, a large portion of the mechanical work required for walking comes from muscle-tendons crossing the ankle joint. Elastic energy storage and return in the Achilles tendon during each step enhance the efficiency of ankle muscle-tendon mechanical work far beyond what is possible for work performed by knee and hip joint muscle-tendons. Key Words: gait, locomotion, walking, energetics, exoskeleton, efficiency  INTRODUCTION  Human walking mechanics have long been described using an inverted pendulum analogy (5). The body center of mass travels in an arc trajectory such that it rises and decelerates during the first half of stance, and lowers and accelerates during the second half of stance, similar to an inverted pendulum. By coupling a regular pendulum to an inverted pendulum to make a swing leg and a stance leg, a simple passive model can reproduce the basic movement and energy patterns of human walking (15,20). Despite their simplicity, passive pendular models make a number of key predictions about the energetics of bipedal walking. First, energy can be conserved by exchanging kinetic and gravita- tional potential energy during the stance phase of each step. Second, leg swing can be purely passive under certain initial conditions. Third, the major source of energy loss during walking is the step-to-step transition (16). At this time, the center of mass must be redirected from moving downward and forward to moving upward and forward. This redirection requires mechanical work to maintain steady speed walking dynamics (16).  Simple models also provide insight into how the mechan- ical energy lost in the foot-ground collision is replaced by positive mechanical work performed by the legs. One way to perform the work is to generate an impulsive push-off along the trailing limb just before the leading limb collides with  the ground. An alternative way to power level walking in the model is to use active hip torque (15). Either of these methods could be done solely with active power production or by supplementing active power production with recovered energy that was previously stored in elastic elements.","id":"49539129-b874-4998-8289-f477ad875f74"}

In this paper, we dis- cuss the effect of a performance augmenting exoskeleton on the metabolic cost of an able-bodied user\/pilot during periodic squat- ting. We investigated whether an exoskeleton device will signiﬁ- cantly reduce the metabolic cost and what is the inﬂuence of the chosen device control strategy. By measuring oxygen consumption, minuteventilation,heartrate,bloodoxygenation,andmuscleEMG during 5-min squatting series, at one squat every 2 s, we show the effects of using a prototype robotic knee exoskeleton under three different noninvasive control approaches: gravity compensation approach, position-based approach, and a novel oscillator-based approach.Thelatterproposesanovelcontrolthatensuressynchro- nization of the device and the user. Statistically signiﬁcant decrease in physiological responses can be observed when using the robotic knee exoskeleton under gravity compensation and oscillator-based control.

INTRODUCTION  W EARABLE robots, also known as the exoskeleton de-  vices, are being developed to either augment the abil- ities of able-bodied humans or to substitute\/improve condition of people with impaired physical abilities [1]. Such devices have been the subject of research for many years and various mechanism design and control issues have been discussed in the literature, see, for example, a comprehensive overview by Dollar and Herr [2]. Whether augmenting abilities or improv- ing disabilities, the purpose of assistive exoskeleton devices is to provide useful mechanical power by means of synchronous operation with the person that is wearing it [3].  The human–robot interface is crucial for a safe and com- fortable interaction with a wearable robotic device [4].

Abstract—Neuromuscular impairment associated with cere- bral palsy (CP) often leads to life-long walking deﬁcits. Our goal was to evaluate the ability of a novel untethered wearable ankle exoskeleton to reduce the severity of gait pathology from CP. In this clinical feasibility study of ﬁve individuals with CP, we used instrumented gait analysis to quantify how powered plantar-ﬂexor assistance affected gait mechanics following multi-visit acclimation. Compared to how each participant walked normally, walking with unteth- ered exoskeleton assistance resulted in improved ankle plantar-ﬂexion and knee extension; residual ﬂexion deformity across the lower-extremity improved by a clinically signif- icant 14.4 (p = 0.022). Powered plantar-ﬂexor assistance increased average total positive ankle power by 44% (p = 0.037), and resulted in a 30% reduction in average negative biological ankle power (p = 0.004) and a 29% reduction in average positive hip power (p = 0.009). These ﬁndings suggest that powered ankle assistance augmented, rather than simply replaced, biological function to produce a more efﬁcient gait pattern, which was corroborated by a 19% improvement in metabolic cost of transport (p = 0.011). This study provides evidence in support of the continued investigation of ankle assistance in mobility and rehabilita- tion interventions for this patient population.

Given the heterogeneity of gait patterns in children with cerebral palsy (CP), the sensor placement and analysis algorithm may inﬂuence the validity of the results. This study aimed at comparing the spatiotemporal measurement performances of three wearable conﬁgurations deﬁned by different sensor positioning on the lower limbs: (1) shanks and thighs, (2) shanks, and (3) feet. The three conﬁgurations were selected based on their potential to be used in daily life for children with CP and typically developing (TD) controls. For each conﬁguration, dedicated gait analysis algorithms were used to detect gait events and compute spatiotemporal parameters. Fifteen children with CP and 11 TD controls were included. Accuracy, precision, and agreement of the three conﬁgurations were determined in comparison with an optoelectronic system as a reference. The three conﬁgurations were comparable for the evaluation of TD children and children with a low level of disability (CP-GMFCS I) whereas the shank-and-thigh-based conﬁguration was more robust regarding children with a higher level of disability (CP-GMFCS II–III).

Such a side effect causes unnatural posture and additional effort for the wearer to maintain the body balance. To minimize the side effect, this paper proposes a control method of an exoskeletal robot to assist a certain target motion with body weight support and balance maintenance functions at the same time. The exoskeletal robot used in this study measures the center of pressure on the wearer’s feet in real-time using air pressure sensors embedded in the soles of the shoes. Then the proposed control method determines the direction of the assistive force to assist the wearers balancing. The desired assistance torque required for realizing the proposed assistance method is precisely generated by series elastic actuators installed at the hip and knee joints of the exoskeletal robot. In the experiments, an assistance effect is veriﬁed by measuring the EMG signals of the six lower-limb muscles that are mainly involved in the target movement. This paper also introduces the experimental results that show the proposed assistive method reduces the EMG signal in ﬁve muscles, and reduces the variation of the COP movement compared to the case where only the body weight support method is applied in the control of the exoskeletal robot. These demonstrate that the proposed assistance method effectively assists in balancing and body weight supporting effectively.

In this paper, a human-robot cooperation control method using compliance factor with feedback torque and adjustable stiffness is proposed, which can arbitrarily change the current motion trajectory according to the user's active intention torque, while the knee exoskeleton can maintain the compliance and stability of the motion. The compliance factor includes stiffness adjustment items and torque adjustment items. The stiffness change feedback based on SEA improves the flexibility. The intention amplification function is designed to enhance the user's active intention. The proposed method is validated by the designed knee exoskeleton. When feedback compliance factor, knee exoskeleton has good compliance and flexibility. In extension and flexion, the highest γ values (γ reflects the intensity of the subject's initiative) are 3.390 and 3.705, respectively. I. INTRODUCTION Wearable lower limb exoskeleton robots have been developed to assist in treating stroke and other diseases, enhance human strength, or supplement human capabilities [1], [2], [3]. A variety of assisted exoskeleton robots have been developed to help humans complete the desired motions and tasks [4], [5]. The exoskeleton robot has direct physical interaction with human work, so human-robot interaction (human-robot interaction) or human-robot cooperation has become a hot field in robotics [6], [7]. In order to achieve seamless and intuitive human-robot cooperation, an important task is to let robots understand human intentions. Predefined motions cannot meet the control requirements of human-machine collaboration, and researchers have developed control methods based on human intention feedback [8], [9]. A way to directly obtain the information of human robot interaction status, the interactive force\/torque sensor has the advantages of convenient installation, stable data transmission, low cost, and is easier to be integrated into the robot.

However, cur- rent mode classiﬁcation strategies for exoskeletons often require user-speciﬁc tuning, have a slow update rate, and rely on additional sensors outside of the exoskeleton sen- sor suite.

Our ap- proach removed the limitations of previous systems as it is 1) subject-independent (i.e., no user-speciﬁc data), 2) ca- pable of continuously classifying for smooth and seamless mode transitions, and 3) only utilizes minimal wearable sen- sors native to a conventional hip exoskeleton. We optimized our model, based on several important factors contribut- ing to overall performance, such as transition label timing, model architecture, and sensor placement, which provides a holistic understanding of mode classiﬁer design. Our optimized DL model showed a 3.13% classiﬁcation error (steady-state: 0.80 ± 0.38% and transitional: 6.49 ± 1.42%), outperforming other machine learning-based benchmarks commonly practiced in the ﬁeld (p<0.05). Furthermore, our multi-modal analysis indicated that our model can main- tain high performance in different settings such as unseen slopes on stairs or ramps. Thus, our study presents a novel locomotion mode framework, capable of advancing robotic exoskeleton applications toward assisting community am- bulation.

Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.  Exoskeletons aiding locomotion entered the popular imagination over a century ago, followed by a series of early patents and prototypes1–5. Among other advances in the late twentieth and early twenty-first cen- tury, funding from the Exoskeleton for Human Performance Augmen- tation Program6 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States enabled the development of wearable robotic devices for the lower extremities (in particular, the Berkeley lower-extremity exoskeleton, BLEEX7,8; the Sarcos Guardian XO9; and the MIT quasi-passive exoskeleton10–13) to augment strength and reduce effort during the carriage of load. By taking load off the wearer and providing assistive joint torques during walking, these weight-bearing lower-extremity exoskeletons sought to increase load capacity, improve efficiency and endurance, and reduce the perceived difficulty of walk- ing11, potentially benefitting military personnel, first responders and weekend warriors. Measuring the metabolic cost of exoskeleton-aided locomotion became the gold standard for quantifying wearer effort and exertion. As such, demonstrating metabolic cost reductions compared to walking without the robot became a major goal for exoskeletons designed to augment strength and performance.

Gregg3, and Nicholas Gans4  Abstract—This paper presents a time-invariant extremum seeking controller (ESC) for nonlinear autonomous systems with limit cycles. For this time-invariant ESC, we propose a method to prove the closed loop system has an asymptotically stable limit cycle. The method is based on a perturbation theorem for maps, and, unlike existing techniques that use averaging and singular perturbation tools, it is not limited to weakly nonlinear systems. We use a typical example system to show that our method does indeed establish asymptotic stability of the limit cycle with minimal amplitude. Utilizing the example, we provide a general guide for analytic computations that are required to apply our method. The corresponding Mathematica code is available as supplementary material.

INTRODUCTION  systems, the dither frequency is chosen to be smaller than the oscillation frequency of the plant states [6].  However, there are applications where the plant does not operate at a ﬁxed time-scale. Human locomotion is one example, which exhibits varying time-scales based on the walking speed) [11]. In a transfemoral powered prosthetic leg, the evolution of the knee and the ankle joints are typically synchronized to an external signal, e.g., the human’s hip signal [12], [13]. In the application of time-based ESC with such periodic systems with varying time-scales, if the desired task results in slow operation speed, then the use of ﬁxed time- based ESC parameters would violate the time-scale separation thus, the ESC adaptation can no longer be guaranteed to be stable [14]. Although newer forms of ESC using high- frequency dither signals can handle varying time-scales [15]– [17], the introduction of fast oscillations in the system might be undesirable for precise trajectory tracking applications.  Limit cycles occur in numerous engineering applications, e.g., tracking error response in rehabilitation robots [1], self- excited vibrations in automotive braking systems [2], oscil- latory wing response in aircraft [3], which can limit the performance and safety of the system. Feedback control can reduce the size of the limit cycle but cannot completely eliminate it. To improve performance, the control requirement is often to enforce a “smallest”, stable limit cycle.","id":"746af1ba-9a55-43bf-9d38-ba029cb23a45"}

Understanding the physiological origin of these features is essential for enhancing the mobility of elderly people.  Despite previous efforts, the origin of both increased energetic cost (15-30% for the ages of 70-90, Fig-A, [1]) and slower preferred walking speed (0.2-0.5 ms-1 for the same ages) remains obscure. For example, it has been shown that none of the basal metabolism, mechanical work, and stability measures explain this inefficiency of elderly walking. Similarly, the cost of transport (CoT, metabolic energy cost per walking distance), a widely used criterion for preferred walking speed of animals, do not explain the slower preferred walking speed of elderlies, since the CoT- speed curve of elderlies does not shift towards slower speed (Fig-A). Identifying the origin of elderly gait remains a challenging problem, since it is difficult to control each physiological properties independently as all changes occur simultaneously along aging.  investigate the contribution of physiological changes to elderly gait in simulation.  Main Results We find that, as observed in elderly gait, the model simulating the common physiological changes shows an increased CoT (16%, Fig-B). However, optimizing for CoT does not suggest a slower preferred walking speed. Instead, we find that a slower preferred speed (by about 0.25 ms-1) in line with experimental observations emerges if the model is optimized for fatigue of transport (FoT, muscle fatigue per walking distance, Fig-C) or stress of transport (SoT, muscle stress per walking distance, Fig-D).  Our detailed model analysis of the contributing physiological changes further suggests that both the metabolic cost increase and the slower walking speed are mainly related to a reduction in muscle strength and mass in the elderly population. We also discuss the effect of other physiological changes and potential ramifications of these findings for improving mobility in elderlies.","id":"47ec1ba4-12ee-40e9-ab27-ab46ae242f22"}

Thomas3  Abstract—Lower-limb wearable robots designed to assist peo- ple in everyday activities must reliably recover from any mo- mentary confusion about what the user is doing. Such confusion might arise from momentary sensor failure, collision with an obstacle, losing track of gait due to an out-of-distribution stride, etc. Systems that infer a user’s walking condition from angle measurements using Bayesian filters (e.g., extended Kalman filters) have been shown to accurately track gait across a range of activities. However, due to the fundamental problem structure and assumptions of Bayesian filter implementations, such estimators risk becoming ‘lost’ with little hope of a quick recovery. In this paper, we 1) introduce a Monte Carlo- based metric to quantify the robustness of pattern-tracking gait estimators, 2) propose strategies for improving tracking robustness, and 3) systematically evaluate them against this new metric using a publicly available gait biomechanics dataset. Our results, aggregating 2,700 trials of simulated walking of 10 able- bodied subjects under random perturbations, suggest that drastic improvements in robustness (from 8.9% to 99%) are possible using relatively simple modifications to the estimation process without noticeably degrading estimator accuracy.

INTRODUCTION  A ROBOTIC exoskeleton is a wearable device worn by  humans and can be attached to human limbs to complete the work together with the movement. It is mainly composed of a frame worn outside the human body and a power system. It is characterized by relying on the power system to help human limb joints and muscle movement, which is used to enhance, extend, compensate or replace human limb functions and capabilities [1], such as enhancing human performance, increasing endurance, and assisting the disabled and the elderly intheirmovements.Theapplicationsofthelowerlimbsaremore abundant than those of the upper limbs [2], because they are all related to the walking function of human beings: on the one hand,walkingbipedallyanduprightisamanifestationofhuman  beingsdistinguishingthemselvesfromotheranimals,andisalso a prerequisite for liberating human hands to create and use tools and prompting the brain to continuously evolve; on the other hand,humanbeingswanttobreakthroughthelimitsofthelower limbs, such as strength, speed, endurance and so on, in order to realize the needs of operations in their specialized ﬁelds [3].","id":"e54eee03-0a85-43c5-8772-c4f26696ad0a"}

Rouse  1,4,5 ✉  Joint mechanical impedance, which describes the instantaneous relationship between kinematic perturbations and the resulting torque response, plays an important role in the way humans ambulate, interact with the environment, and respond to disturbances. Recent studies have quantified how the stiffness component of mechanical impedance varies during walking. However, the extent to which humans can voluntarily regulate leg joint stiffness is not yet known. Our study sought to quantify the accuracy and precision of the neuromotor system to voluntarily regulate ankle joint stiffness while seated, and compare these data to the well-known abilities to regulate ankle joint torque and position. We tested individuals’ ability to to regulate these quantities at three different magnitudes: 20%, 40%, and 60% of a maximum value. Our results showed that subjects were able to voluntarily regulate ankle joint stiffness, and that the normalized accuracy and precision of stiffness regulation were not different than those of position or torque for targets at magnitudes of 20% of a maximum value. However, the accuracy and precision of stiffness regulation were statistically different than those of position and torque for targets at magnitudes of 40% of the maximum values. At moderate targets, the similarity of the ability to regulate ankle joint stiffness when compared to the abilities to regulate joint torque and position highlights the importance of a comprehensive description of lower-limb biomechanics that includes consideration of joint mechanical impedance, in addition to the common descriptions of joint torque and position.  Our fundamental understanding of how human locomotion is regulated by the neuromuscular system mainly stems from analyses of how the legs are moved during gait (joint angles), and how effort is provided throughout locomotion (joint torques)1. These data have formed the core of locomotor biomechanics for over a century. In addition, this information has many important implications, including serving as a benchmark for diagnosis and treatment of neuromotor pathologies and providing a guide for the development of assistive technologies, among other uses. However, this fundamental biomechanical description of human locomotion is incomplete.","id":"5fd09363-c3c5-4b35-a970-b2bf43efee36"}

Providing assistive torque that compensates for the user’s remaining muscle contributions is a growing and challenging ﬁeld within exoskeleton control. In this article, ankle joint torques were estimated using electromyography (EMG)-driven neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) model and an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) model in seven movement tasks, including fast walking, slow walking, self-selected speed walking, and isokinetic dorsi\/plantar ﬂexion at 60◦\/s and 90◦\/s. In each method, EMG signals and ankle joint angles were used as input, the models were trained with data from 3-D motion analysis, and ankle joint torques were predicted. Six cases using different motion trials as calibration (for the NMS model)\/training (for the ANN) were devised, and the agreement between the predicted and measured ankle joint torques was computed. We found that the NMS model could overall better predict ankle joint torques from EMG and angle data than the ANN model with some exceptions; the ANN predicted ankle joint torques with better agreement when trained with data from the same movement. The NMS model predicted ankle joint torque best when calibrated with trials during which EMG reached maximum levels, whereas the ANN predicted well when trained with many trials and types of movements. In addition, the ANN prediction may become less reliable when  predicting unseen movements. Detailed comparative studies of methods to predict ankle joint torque are crucial for determining strategies for exoskeleton control.","id":"71c940c2-8178-48dc-928c-ac46acb85e7f"}

A pair of bilateral knee exoskeletons can potentially reduce crouch gait in this population; doing so would presumably enhance mobility for such individuals. This paper describes the implementation of a knee exoskeleton and control approach intended to improve knee kinematics in an individual with CP. The knee exoskeleton provides extension torque to combat crouch during stance and employs trajectory control to encourage knee flexion and extension during swing. The device and controller were tested on a single adult individual with CP. Though the device and controller achieved the desired local effect, the step length and walking speed of the participant were reduced. I. INTRODUCTION Cerebral Palsy (CP) has an incidence rate of approximately 2 out of every 1000 births [1], and represents the most common physical disability in children [2]. Individuals with CP often exhibit irregular gait patterns, the most common of which, crouch gait, is characterized by excessive knee flexion [3]. Crouch gait can lead to joint pain and degradation, not only at the knee but also at other joints of the lower limb [4]. As such, the mobility of individuals with CP is often limited and degrades with age [5]. Recently, exoskeletons have emerged and become a viable approach to augment lower limb motion, and it is reasonable to conjecture that a powered exoskeletal device could reduce crouch gait and facilitate improved walking movement in individuals with CP. While prior work has explored the rehabilitative potential of exoskeleton assistance in children [6-9], this paper explores the ability of an exoskeleton to improve the kinematics and mobility of an adult participant during level-ground walking. As shown in [10], crouch gait is characterized by a substantially flexed nominal knee angle throughout the gait cycle, and a substantially decreased range of motion of the knee. This deviation from healthy patterns is accompanied also by a more dorsiflexed average ankle angle, and a reduced ankle range of motion. Unlike knee and ankle motion, sagittal plane motion of the hip is quite similar to that exhibited during healthy gait","id":"abfd52fd-2527-4cc1-a734-be9f6eac4db3"}

Lerner  1,2, Diane L. Damiano1 & Thomas C. Bulea 1  Individuals with cerebral palsy often exhibit crouch gait, a debilitating and inefficient walking pattern marked by excessive knee flexion that worsens with age. To address the need for improved treatment, we sought to evaluate if providing external knee extension assistance could reduce the excessive burden placed on the knee extensor muscles as measured by knee moments. We evaluated a novel pediatric exoskeleton designed to provide appropriately-timed extensor torque to the knee joint during walking in a multi-week exploratory clinical study. Seven individuals (5–19 years) with mild-moderate crouch gait from cerebral palsy (GMFCS I-II) completed the study. For six participants, powered knee extension assistance favorably reduced the excessive stance-phase knee extensor moment present during crouch gait by a mean of 35% in early stance and 76% in late stance. Peak stance-phase knee and hip extension increased by 12° and 8°, respectively. Knee extensor muscle activity decreased slightly during exoskeleton-assisted walking compared to baseline, while knee flexor activity was elevated in some participants. These findings support the use of wearable exoskeletons for the management of crouch gait and provide insights into their future implementation.  Many individuals with cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent cause of physical disability in childhood1, present an increasingly flexed or “crouched” gait pattern throughout the lifespan2. This pathological gait pattern, known as crouch gait, increases the metabolic cost of transport3 and is associated with knee pain and degradation due to elevated joint loads4. Despite efforts to manage crouch gait surgically5,6 and with physical therapy7, walking defi- cits generally remain after treatment such that approximately 50% of affected individuals lose the ability to walk independently in adulthood8. Effective gait rehabilitation remains a major clinical challenge in CP9.","id":"c3c0cfb2-602f-4a4b-8908-b8b2c7ba9daa"}

In order to it is crucial to guarantee achieve high performance robots, harmonious integration between software and hardware. Hence, the development of such capable robotic platforms must address design requirements that meet the assumptions of typical model- based controllers but also respect the physical limitations of a real system. First, we show that proper hardware design choices can greatly aid the control algorithm by approximating the physical robot to the template assumptions. We include actuation and sensing design examples that allows a simple model to capture a major portion of the natural dynamic behavior of the physical machine. Results are applied to a real robot (Figure 1) and we show that the adopted methodology is able to address typical problems in legged robots such as high bandwidth force control and robustness to impact. Finally, a simple model-based balance controller that takes advantage of the ﬁdelity of the template model to the real machine is implemented. These are examples of software-hardware co- design processes that vastly facilitate robotic control.  I. INTRODUCTION  To build legged machines capable of dynamic physical interactions with the environment remains as one of the great challenges in the robotics ﬁeld. These interactions consist of complex dynamic phenomena that involve the control algorithm, the hardware and the outside world. Hence, it is clear that the development of dynamic legged robots should tightly integrate the reasoning process of both software and hardware. The design of both sides should mutually adapt the characteristics and constrains in order to maximize the synergy between the two domains.","id":"cf7a372b-bcd8-4dd3-902e-ed9db3cb2cce"}

Patient preference, a formalized representation of “what patients want”, provides an efficient method for identifying appropriate prosthesis mechanics. Unfortunately, a lack of the scientific and technological tools necessary to formally measure and rigorously understand preference has led to limitations in ascertaining its role in the prescription process. In this study, our objective was to understand how preference changes with walking speed and how preference corresponds to clinical metrics of gait performance. We characterized preferred stiffness of the Variable Stiffness Prosthetic Ankle Foot (VSPA Foot) across speeds in persons with below knee amputation. We then assessed metabolic expenditure and performance in the ten-meter walk test at several stiffness values around the preferred stiffness. Preferred stiffness did not correlate with body mass, and was lower at the self-selected treadmill walking speed than at either the fast or slow speeds. There was a significant increase in self-selected overground speed in the ten meter walk test at stiffness values at or above the preferred stiffness. Changes to prosthetic ankle stiffness within +\/- 30% of the preferred stiffness did not significantly affect metabolic expenditure. These results indicate that preferred stiffness may be associated with significant changes in self-selected overground walking speed (p < 0.001), and may not be driven by metabolic optimality (p > 0.93). This outcome motivates future work to identify other potential drivers of preference, including biomechanical correlates of gait, and highlights the potential value of formally incorporating patient preference into the clinical prescription process. I. INTRODUCTION The current prescription paradigm for commercial lower-extremity prostheses is hampered by a lack of robust metrics to identify optimal clinical solutions. In parallel with shaping a socket, prosthetists work with patients to select appropriate prosthetic componentry. Experience, including trial-and-error methodologies, play a substantial role in selecting and adjusting these components. In a typical clinical session, the prosthetist observes the patient’s gait and looks for several indicators of fit and function. Based on these observations, the prosthetist may choose to make adjustments, or may try new component selections [1], [2]","id":"123bc333-3043-4812-9d58-a64edb2cf8ac"}

Young   AbstractMachine learning (ML) algorithms present an opportunity to estimate joint kinetics using a limited set of mechanical sensors. These estimates could be used as a continuous reference signal for exoskeleton control, able to modulate exoskeleton assistance in real-world environments. In this study, sagittal plane biological hip torque during level ground, incline and decline walking was calculated using inverse dynamics of human subject data. Subsequently, this torque was estimated using neural network (NN) and XGBoost ML models. Model inputs consisted solely of mechanical sensor data onboard a robotic hip exoskeleton. These results were compared to a baseline method of estimating hip torque as the mean torque profile during ambulation. On average across conditions, the NN and XGBoost models estimated biological hip torque with an RMSE of 0.116±0.015 and 0.108±0.011 Nm\/kg, respectively, which was significantly less than the baseline estimation that had an RMSE of 0.300±0.145 Nm\/kg (p<0.05). Fitting the baseline method to ambulation mode specific data significantly reduced overall RMSE by 59.3%; however, the ML models were still significantly better than the baseline method (p<0.05). These results show that machine learning algorithms can estimate biological hip torque using only mechanical sensors onboard a hip exoskeleton better than simply using an average torque profile. This suggests that these estimation models could be suitable for modulating exoskeleton assistance. Additionally, no evidence suggested the need to train separate ML models for each ambulation mode as estimation RMSE was not significantly different across unified and separated ML models.  assistance modulation. Given these limitations, it remains unclear how well this approach would modulate bio-inspired assistance during multimodal, overground walking.","id":"17d1d7ae-945d-472e-afac-202ee282e50e"}

T., Bartlett, H.L., and Goldfarb M., Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes the design of a new type of knee prosthesis called a stance-control, swing-assist (SCSA) knee prosthesis. The device is motivated by the recognition that energetically-passive stance-controlled microprocessor-controlled knees (SCMPKs) offer many desirable characteristics, such as quiet operation, low weight, high-impedance stance support, and an inertially-driven swing-phase motion. Due to the latter, however, SCMPKs are also highly susceptible to swing-phase perturbations, which can increase the likelihood of falling. The SCSA prosthesis supplements the behavior of an SCMPK with a small motor that maintains the low output impedance of the SCMPK swing state, while adding a supplemental closed-loop controller around it. This paper elaborates upon the motivation for the SCSA prosthesis, describes the design of a prosthesis prototype, and provides human-subject testing data that demonstrates potential device benefits relative to an SCMPK during both non-perturbed and perturbed walking.  Index Terms—Transfemoral, controlled knee, MPK, biomechanics, amputation  prosthesis, microprocessor-  Swing phase is achieved in SCMPKs via inertial coupling between the double-pendulum of the thigh and shank (i.e., forward acceleration of the thigh drives initial knee flexion, while deceleration of the thigh drives subsequently knee extension). A small amount of damping at the knee (relative to the level of stance damping employed in stance-controlled knees) limits excessive knee flexion during swing and avoids terminal impact at full knee extension. One of the substantial benefits of the inertial coupling-based swing-phase movement of passive knee prostheses is that the movement of the knee is naturally and fundamentally coordinated with the movement and intent of the wearer. The same property that enables this natural coordination, however, also makes the swing-phase movement highly-susceptible to perturbations. Specifically, the same low impedance characteristic that enables the wearer to easily enables environmental disturbances, such as stumble or scuff, to substantially influence the movement of the knee. Stance-knee stability relies on full extension at terminal swing, and thus, lack of robustness in swing phase jeopardizes stance-knee stability.  generate  swing-phase motion,  also  I.

IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS  Adaptive Admittance Control Strategy for a Robotic Knee Exoskeleton With a Nonlinear Variable Stiffness Actuator  Bing Chen , Lei Zhou, Bin Zi  , Eric Li  , and Dan Zhang , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—This article presents the design and control of a robotic knee exoskeleton for gait rehabilitation of patients with knee joint impairments. First, the hardware design of the exoskeleton is presented, including the mechanical structure, actuator design and conﬁguration, and electronic system. Based on the nonlinear characteristics of human muscles, a nonlinear variable stiffness actuator (NLVSA) is designed for the actuation system of the exoskeleton. Next, the modeling of the NLVSA is described. In addition, an adaptive admittance control strategy comprising a spar- row search optimization algorithm-based long short-term memory neural network model and an adaptive admittance control algorithm based on the radial basis function neural network (RBFAAC) is proposed for the exoskeleton. Finally, a pilot study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the robotic knee exoskeleton. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the designed NLVSA, and the exoskeleton has the potential for human knee rehabilitation by providing effective assistance with the proposed control strategy. With the proposed RBFAAC algorithm, the average root mean square error between the reference and actual knee joint angles is 1.24° at different walking speeds.

INTRODUCTION  N OWADAYS, the motor function damage of a human knee  joint caused by a stroke, spinal cord injury, osteoarthritis, and other related diseases often occurs [1], [2], which makes it difﬁcult for individuals with muscle weakness or paralysis to perform activities of daily living [3]. Medical investigation demonstrates that lower limb motor function can be gradually improved by timely and repetitive rehabilitation training in indi- viduals with gait disorders [1], [4]. Therefore, medical devices such as robotic knee exoskeletons that can enable individuals with knee joint impairments to regain the ability to walk with a normal gait and, hence, to enhance their independence and well-being are desirable [5].","id":"fb3cc4a3-4d39-4a79-86cb-f9e51b67700c"}

Results show a 34% reduction in electrical power requirements at the hip joints during the stance phase of the gait cycle with the cooperative controller compared to using electric motors alone. I. INTRODUCTION Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition with no available cure to date. Despite ongoing research in areas such as stem cell therapy and neuronal regeneration, these fields are still in preclinical states and thus far have made little clinical impact at the patient level. On the other hand, functional electrical stimulation (FES) is already in use in areas such as breathing, bowel and bladder function, and hand grasp [1, 2]. In the past few decades, many researchers have developed FES-based gait restoration systems for persons with paraplegia [3-6], including the commercially-available Parastep system [7]. However, these devices have shown limited everyday usability due to some key limitations such as muscle fatigue, uneven muscle response, and lack of sensing for control purposes, resulting in limited run time and inconsistent gait motions [1, 8]. Some researchers have addressed these problems using hybrid systems combining FES with computer-controlled passive lower limb braces [9-14]. Others have developed fully-powered, electric motor-actuated lower limb exoskeletons without the use of FES [15-22]. The authors have recently developed a powered lower limb exoskeleton, shown in Fig. 1 [23, 24]. Whereas prior publications by the authors have described the design and demonstrated the efficacy of the powered exoskeleton [23, 24], this paper describes the use of supplemental FES of the hamstring muscles to enhance stance phase propulsion during level walking.

Our approach combines the concepts of machine learning and musculoskeletal modeling. Methods: We compared our novel design with a musculoskeletal model (MM) and 2 continuous EMG decoders based on artificial neural networks (ANNs): multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and nonlinear autoregressive neural networks with exogenous inputs (NARX networks). EMG and joint kinematics data were collected from 10 non-disabled and 1 transradial amputee subject. The offline performance tested across 3 different conditions (i.e. varied arm postures, shifted electrode locations, and noise-contaminated EMG signals) and online performance for a virtual postural matching task was quantified. Finally, we implemented the N2M2 to operate a prosthetic hand and tested functional task performance. Results: The N2M2 made more accurate predictions than the MLP in all postures and electrode locations (p<0.003). For estimated MCP joint angles, the N2M2 was less sensitive to noisy EMG signals than the MM or NARX network with respect to error (p<0.032) as well as the NARX network with respect to correlation (p=0.007). Additionally, the N2M2 had better online task performance than the NARX network (p≤0.030). Conclusion: Overall, we have found that combining the concepts of machine learning and musculoskeletal modeling has resulted in a more robust joint kinematics decoder than either concept individually. Significance: The outcome of this study may result in a novel, highly reliable controller for powered prosthetic hands.

Over-ground leg ex- oskeletons commonly use traditional rigid link architectures or support the weight of a user by strapping the user in a harness. This results in bulky and large architectures which are cumbersome and restrictive. C-ALEX is a leg exoskeleton without a rigid link structure which has been used in gait training on a treadmill. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using the C-ALEX exoskeleton over-ground. We converted C-ALEX into a carted system for over-ground use. We tested the architecture on eight healthy subjects to compare the controller’s RMS joint torque errors, the effects on step height, joint angles and the deviation of ankle trajectories from target trajectories. The results show that C-ALEX’s controller and tension planner have comparable RMS torque errors with no signiﬁcant difference between the two use cases. C-ALEX is able to increase the step height, affect knee ﬂexion in both walking conditions with no signiﬁcant difference. There is signiﬁcant difference between C-ALEX’s ability to control hip ﬂexion angles and deviation area over-ground and on a treadmill.  I. INTRODUCTION  on the range of motion and degrees-of-freedom of users are present in such architectures. In summary, the current over-ground gait training technologies is severely limited.

IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS  Gait-Generation Strategy for Lower Limb Exoskeleton Based on Central Pattern Generator  Wen Duan , Weihai Chen , Member, IEEE, Jianhua Wang , Jingmeng Liu , Zhongcai Pei and Jianer Chen  Abstract—To improve human–machine interactions, many studies have replicated the human motor nervous system to control lower limb exoskeletons. However, this approach is hindered by its intricacy and the disparities be- tween human and machine capabilities, leading to subopt- imal adaptability and constrained practicality. This article presents a gait-generation strategy for lower limb exoskele- tons utilizing central pattern generators (CPGs). This method offers a simpliﬁed model compared with the tradi- tional CPG methods, signiﬁcantly easing the parameter op- timization process. The strategy is bifurcated into two seg- ments. The initial segment encapsulates the human motor nervous system, constructs a musculoskeletal structure, and generates a basic bionic gait. The subsequent segment employs adaptive oscillators to assimilate and reﬁne this basic gait through weak coupling theory. It further broadens the application range by integrating variational controllers and state observers. We implemented this strategy in a bench-type lower limb exoskeleton, allowing adjustments in walking speed and integrating a preference control algorithm for personalized exoskeleton management.

Some common metrics exist for evaluating these systems, such as metabolic cost, but they are incomplete with regards to the many other characteristics to be compared between systems. To this end, we are developing holistic test methods, speciﬁcally those for lower body wearable robots focused on performance augmentation. We discuss the test methods’ structure, considerations, and development. Prototypes of the test methods have been exercised with a user wearing a B-Temia Dermoskeleton system. Our initial development has led to a baseline set of basic and applied tasks that can be evaluated comparatively between performing the task without and with the system, measuring simple task-based metrics based on time, repetitions, loading capacity, and range of motion. Future work includes exercising the test methods with more wearable robotic systems and formulating a working task group to assist in driving development.  I.  INTRODUCTION  Wearable robots and exoskeletons are a growing technol- ogy that has seen rapid growth in recent years. The most common use of the modern day wearable robot is in medical rehabilitation, with exoskeletons such as the ReWalk 6.0 [1] and the Ekso GT [2], helping users regain limb control and movement while recovering from an injury. Exoskeleton sys- tems are also used in the commercial space with exoskeletons such as the Ekso Works [2], demonstrating use in construction and industrial environments by providing passive augmentation to an able bodied user. For military use, exoskeletons from the Warrior Web Program [3] and the B-Temia Dermoskeleton [4] (see Figure 1), are providing active human augmentation to able bodied users, to extend and improve task performance.

M. Cox, Jonas Rubenson§, and Gregory S. Sawicki§  Abstract—Wearable robotics offers a unique opportunity to explore the fundamental science of integrated systems with both engineered and biological parts. But, lacking a mechanistic understanding of to assistive technologies, the state of the art in design development is presently a sophisticated form of automated trial and error. the restrictions of human Progress experimentation that make it difficult to assess the direct impact of wearable robots on underlying muscles, tendons and bones. The next stage of development in wearable robotics requires expanding studies ‘under the skin’ and ‘out into the world’. Developing animal models to explore locomotion with wearable robotics could offer the opportunity to answer questions up and down the broader spatiotemporal scale that are not currently possible in humans. To fill this gap, we have built the first ever wearable robotic device for a freely-locomoting, non-human, bipedal animal (Numida melaegris = Guinea fowl), a species whose gait closely mirror human locomotion mechanics. We found that a passive soft-exosuit design that parallels current human passive-elastic ankle exoskeletons in function was both well tolerated and provided consistent torques. Preliminary data showed birds systematically change their kinematics in response to changes to exo-suit spring stiffness, adjusting the timing but not magnitude of the assistive torques. This animal model for wearable robotics allows us to address questions from short- term adaptations in musculoskeletal dynamics and sensorimotor signaling within a single step to broader behavioral and physical changes that come with long term use from whole-body down to individual muscles and nerves.  the biological response  is hampered by  Figure 1: An animal model for wearable robotics overcomes the limitations of human experimentation, expanding spatial and temporal scales of research.  wearable robotics lacks an animal model with which to conduct invasive or long-term experiments.

Based on Angular and torque curves of each joint of the lower limb, the motion of each joint was analyzed and compared during walking up and down stairs and on the flat ground, so as to arrive at the reason why the elderly people struggle to walk up and down stairs, and according to this, the design requirements and overall scheme of the exoskeleton were provided. According to the overall scheme, the exoskeleton was divided into knee component, ankle component and backpack component, and the detailed structural design of the three components was carried out. The hardware and software system of the exoskeleton was designed to complete the acquisition of sensor data and the motion control of the exoskeleton, and to pre-process the gait data for gait recognition. Finally, the assist strategy of the assisted exoskeleton was determined and the experiment was conducted.

Providing personalized external assistance though is challenging due to uncertainties and the time-varying nature of human-robot interaction. Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) op- timization has been investigated for providing assistance to mini- mize energetic expenditure, usually quantiﬁed by metabolic cost. However, this full-body global effect evaluation may not directly reﬂect the local functions of the targeted joint(s). This makes it difﬁcult to assess the direct effect when robotic assistance is pro- vided. In addition, the HIL optimization method usually does not take into account local joint trajectories, a consideration that is important in imposing healthy joint movements and gait patterns for individuals with lower limb motor deﬁcits. In this paper, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based control frameworktoachieveanormativerangeofmotionandgaitpattern ofthehipjointduringwalking.OurRL-basedcontrolprovidesper- sonalized assistance torque proﬁle by heuristically manipulating threecontrolparametersforhipﬂexionandextension,respectively, during walking.

The wearable device, to be worn invisibly underneath clothes, not only ﬁts tightly to the wearer’s lower body, but also comfortably transmits assistive torque to the wearer’s hip\/knee joint. To overcome deﬁciencies in the usability of conventional wearable walking assistance devices, two novel features are proposed: 1) a unique ﬂexible support frame that withstands vertical loads while maintaining the natural curvature of the wearer’s lower body; and 2) a kinematically similar anthropomorphic joint that minimizes the unintended resistance force during the wearer’s usual motions. The developed wearable walking assistance de- vice based on these features was veriﬁed by simulations and experiments whose results are described.

We introduce a task-agnostic controller that assists the user on the basis of instantaneous estimates of lower-limb biological joint moments from a deep neural network. By estimating both hip and knee moments in-the-loop, our approach provided multi-joint, coordinated assistance through our autonomous, clothing-integrated exoskeleton. When deployed during 28 activities, spanning cyclic locomotion to unstructured tasks (for example, passive meandering and high-speed lateral cutting), the network accurately estimated hip and knee moments with an average R2 of 0.83 relative to ground truth. Further, our approach significantly outperformed a best-case task classifier-based method constructed from splines and impedance parameters. When tested on ten activities (including level walking, running, lifting a 25 lb (roughly 11 kg) weight and lunging), our controller significantly reduced user energetics (metabolic cost or lower-limb biological joint work depending on the task) relative to the zero torque condition, ranging from 5.3 to 19.7%, without any manual controller modifications among activities. Thus, this task-agnostic controller can enable exoskeletons to aid users across a broad spectrum of human activities, a necessity for real-world viability.","id":"a07ad7f2-3ef5-44d9-bfaf-61dceb8a6c7e"}

This sense is known as proprio- ception and is essential to human motor control. Although there have been many attempts to create human- mechatronic interactions, there is still no robust, repeatable methodology to reflect proprioceptive information from a synthetic device onto the nervous system. To address this shortcoming, we present an agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI). The AMI is composed of (i) a surgical construct made up of two muscle-tendons—an agonist and an antagonist—surgically connected in series so that contraction of one muscle stretches the other and (ii) a bidirectional efferent-afferent neural control architecture. The AMI preserves the dynamic muscle rela- tionships that exist within native anatomy, thereby allowing proprioceptive signals from mechanoreceptors within both muscles to be communicated to the central nervous system. We surgically constructed two AMIs within the residual limb of a subject with a transtibial amputation. Each AMI sends control signals to one joint of a two-degree- of-freedom ankle-foot prosthesis and provides proprioceptive information pertaining to the movement of that joint. The AMI subject displayed improved control over the prosthesis compared to a group of four subjects having traditional amputation. We also show natural reflexive behaviors during stair ambulation in the AMI subject that do not appear in the cohort of subjects with traditional amputation. In addition, we demonstrate a system for closed-loop joint torque control in AMI subjects. These results provide a framework for integrating bionic systems with human physiology.","id":"afd15bb6-5009-4e7f-8209-704f4a72eca3"}

INTRODUCTION  III. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS  The current powered knee prostheses are widely relying on the ﬁnite-state machine impedance control (FSM-IC) to regulate the dynamics between users, devices and environ- ments. To maximize beneﬁts of the power to individual users, a personalized impedance tuning is indispensable, yet challenging. Recent studies have attempted various approaches to automate the tuning process, and achieved promising results [1]–[3]. However, few work has been focusing on enhancing the tuning efﬁciency in high-dimension parameter space with human-in-the-loop, resulting in a limited scalability for clinical applications. To address the remaining problem, we are in need of a novel automatic method that can efﬁciently obtain a tuning policy, and reduce the time and labor efforts required in online training that involves human users.  To fulﬁll such a requirement, this study developed a novel reinforcement learning based algorithm by taking the frame- work of policy iteration, which enabled the training of tuning policy in both ofﬂine and online manners. Enjoying the advantages from the both training schemes, the method could signiﬁcantly enhance the efﬁciency in policy learning.  II. METHODS  In this study, the proposed algorithm is designed to ﬁnd out an optimal policy, acting as a supplementary parameter tuner to the powered knee prosthesis control, to have users restore a near-normal knee motion. The algorithm is implemented together with a well-established FSM-IC framework [4]. The whole learning process involves two types of updates: the impedance update is executed by the parameter tuner following some speciﬁc policies to adjust impedance for the FSM-IC; whereas the policy update is carried out by the novel policy iteration algorithm where policy evaluation and policy im- provement were alternately performed until meeting stopping conditions. To test the algorithm, we recruited two participants, one able-bodied individual and one transfemoral amputee, and each was asked to perform the treadmill walking task at the speed of 0.6 m\/s.","id":"76b07cd0-6e29-4ca4-ac6a-3eb3dd306e38"}

IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS  Gait-Generation Strategy for Lower Limb Exoskeleton Based on Central Pattern Generator  Wen Duan , Weihai Chen , Member, IEEE, Jianhua Wang , Jingmeng Liu , Zhongcai Pei and Jianer Chen  Abstract—To improve human–machine interactions, many studies have replicated the human motor nervous system to control lower limb exoskeletons. However, this approach is hindered by its intricacy and the disparities be- tween human and machine capabilities, leading to subopt- imal adaptability and constrained practicality. This article presents a gait-generation strategy for lower limb exoskele- tons utilizing central pattern generators (CPGs). This method offers a simpliﬁed model compared with the tradi- tional CPG methods, signiﬁcantly easing the parameter op- timization process. The strategy is bifurcated into two seg- ments. The initial segment encapsulates the human motor nervous system, constructs a musculoskeletal structure, and generates a basic bionic gait. The subsequent segment employs adaptive oscillators to assimilate and reﬁne this basic gait through weak coupling theory. It further broadens the application range by integrating variational controllers and state observers. We implemented this strategy in a bench-type lower limb exoskeleton, allowing adjustments in walking speed and integrating a preference control algorithm for personalized exoskeleton management.

Previous research studies on human-robot interaction and biomechanics have largely been performed with rigid exoskeletons that add significant lower extremities and provide constraints to the wearer’s natural kinematics in both actuated and non-actuated degrees of freedom. Actuated lightweight soft exosuits minimize these effects and provide a unique opportunity to study human-robot interaction in wearable systems without affecting the subjects underlying natural dynamics. In this paper, we present the design and control of a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide biologically realistic torques to ankle, knee, and hip joints through lower extremity soft exosuits. Two different soft exosuits have been designed to deliver assistive forces through Bowden cable transmission to the ankle and hip joints. Through human subject experiments, it is demonstrated that with a real- time admittance controller, accurate force profile tracking can be achieved during walking. The average energy delivered to the test subject was calculated while walking at 1.25 m\/s and actuated with 15% of the total torque required by the biological joints. The results show that the ankle joint received an average of 3.02J during plantar flexion and that the hip joint received 1.67J during flexion each gait cycle.

Moreover, an additional consequence is that a wearer will typically expend an increased amount of energy to complete a desired motion (e.g. walking).

Young aaron.young@me.gatech.edu  A broad goal in the field of powered lower limb exoskeletons is to reduce the metabolic cost of walking. Ankle exoskeletons have successfully achieved this goal by correctly timing a plantarflexor torque during late stance phase. Hip exoskeletons have the poten- tial to assist with both flexion and extension during walking gait, but the optimal timing for maximally reducing metabolic cost is unknown. The focus of our study was to determine the best assistance timing for applying hip assistance through a pneumatic exoskeleton on human subjects. Ten non-impaired subjects walked with a powered hip exoskeleton, and both hip flexion and extension assistance were separately provided at different actuation timings using a simple burst controller. The largest average across-subject reduction in metabolic cost for hip extension was at 90% of the gait cycle (just prior to heel contact) and for hip flexion was at 50% of the gait cycle; this resulted in an 8.4 and 6.1% metabolic reduction, respectively, compared to walking with the unpowered exoskeleton. However, the ideal timing for both flexion and extension assistance varied across subjects. When selecting the assistance timing that maximally reduced metabolic cost for each subject, average metabolic cost for hip extension was 10.3% lower and hip flexion was 9.7% lower than the unpowered condition. When taking into account user preference, we found that subject preference did not correlate with metabolic cost. This indicated that user feedback was a poor method of determining the most metabolically efficient assistance power timing. The findings of this study are relevant to developers of exoskeletons that have a powered hip component to assist during human walking gait.","id":"2bc03a91-7ce8-418d-9848-59c5974e77dc"}

Linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were used for calibration, and 10-fold cross-validation was applied to estimate the system’s accuracy. Results indicate that machine learning regression methods may lead to improved accuracy, but the choice of the kernel function is critical.

McCain1* Katherine R. Saul1 and Gregory S. Sawicki5  , Taylor J. M. Dick2, Tracy N. Giest1, Richard W. Nuckols3, Michael D. Lewek4,  Abstract  Background: Ankle exoskeletons offer a promising opportunity to offset mechanical deficits after stroke by applying the needed torque at the paretic ankle. Because joint torque is related to gait speed, it is important to consider the user’s gait speed when determining the magnitude of assistive joint torque. We developed and tested a novel exoskeleton controller for delivering propulsive assistance which modulates exoskeleton torque magnitude based on both soleus muscle activity and walking speed. The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of the resulting exoskeleton assistance on post-stroke walking performance across a range of walking speeds.  Methods: Six participants with stroke walked with and without assistance applied to a powered ankle exoskeleton on the paretic limb. Walking speed started at 60% of their comfortable overground speed and was increased each minute (n00, n01, n02, etc.). We measured lower limb joint and limb powers, metabolic cost of transport, paretic and non-paretic limb propulsion, and trailing limb angle. Results: Exoskeleton assistance increased with walking speed, verifying the speed-adaptive nature of the controller. Both paretic ankle joint power and total limb power increased significantly with exoskeleton assistance at six walking speeds (n00, n01, n02, n03, n04, n05). Despite these joint- and limb-level benefits associated with exoskeleton assistance, no subject averaged metabolic benefits were evident when compared to the unassisted condition. Both paretic trailing limb angle and integrated anterior paretic ground reaction forces were reduced with assistance applied as compared to no assistance at four speeds (n00, n01, n02, n03). Conclusions: Our results suggest that despite appropriate scaling of ankle assistance by the exoskeleton controller, suboptimal limb posture limited the conversion of exoskeleton assistance into forward propulsion. Future studies could include biofeedback or verbal cues to guide users into limb configurations that encourage the conversion of mechanical power at the ankle to forward propulsion.

Based on this passive dynamics of human locomotion, we develop an energy-efﬁcient braking torque controller for a robotic transtibial prosthesis. The con- troller ﬁrst generates motor current\/torque from human locomotion instead of the battery energy, and then controls the current\/torque with alternating current sensing and voltage-controlled-resistor. On the basis of the low-level motor torque controller, we then propose the impedance model that determines the desired joint torque according to the joint angle and joint velocity, the prosthesis model that converts the desired ankle joint torque to desired motor torque, and the friction model that estimates the friction torque and compensates the joint torque. Step response and frequency response show that the low-level controller can reach the desired torque value within 0.07 s, and has a −3 dB bandwidth of 25.2 Hz.

INTRODUCTION  G AIT training (or exercises) using a robotic exoskeleton  can be an appropriate solution for those who need to improve their walking performance due to aging or disease. Hip and ankle assistance, for example, is expected to lessen the problem of excessive use of the hip muscles or a bent posture to compensateforweakeneddistalmusclestrengthandbalance[1], [2]. It is expected that knee assistance can effectively improve a gait rehabilitation and training program in patients who suffer from arthritis [3] or have joint replacements.  To maximize the training effect using an exoskeleton device, interaction force should be applied naturally in accordance with the wearer’s original walking pattern. Because the exoskeleton device’s weight and motion constraints can distort the user’s originalgaitpattern,reducingthedevice’sweightandimproving its wearability should take precedence. The device’s usability, maintenance and manufacturing costs, and ease of wear are also key factors that cannot be overlooked.","id":"0c9122a3-f782-4c71-af92-a4b42fc9ff35"}

Since the energy supplied by the proposed EMG is discontinuous in time, a tailored energy management circuit is necessary to adapt the harvested energy to the load energy requirements. The electromechanical generator is composed by two series of NdFeB magnets positioned into each condyle and a coil, placed in the pin of the tibial insert, which collects the magnetic flux variations, generated by the knee movements. A total knee replacement (TKR) prototype has been developed and realized in order to reproduce the knee mechanics. Therefore, electrical performances have been evaluated, at the first, measuring the EMG open circuit voltage by means of a high impedance buffer amplifier, and, subsequently, connecting the EMG to the energy management circuit able to manage the produced energy and to power an implanted circuit for force measurement inside the human knee. The tests showed that the EHS is able to supply the measuring circuit guaranteeing a tension between 2.45 V and 2.15 V for 25 ms almost every 1.5 s with a walking velocity of 1 Hz. The tests successfully demonstrate the possibility to power a measurement circuit transmitting the measurement data outside the prosthesis every about one-step and half.

This study aimed to evaluate the effec- tiveness of our exoskeleton in assisting squatting motion using the COP variability as a metric. Six human subjects performed alternate squatting and standing movements while their foot pressure and COP trajecto- ries were recorded using insole pressure sensors. The exercises were performed under three conditions: i) no device, ii) unpowered device, and iii) device with optimal stiffness. Results showed that the variability of the COP trajectory in the anterior-posterior direction of the foot during squatting tended to be lower for the optimal stiffness condition than the no device and unpowered device conditions, indicating the potential usefulness of the device in improving balance during squatting. This study has implications for human-in- the-loop optimization and balance control of the exoskeleton based on COP.  INTRODUCTION  Squatting exercises are frequently used in resistance train- ing and rehabilitation to help people recover from injuries to their lower extremities (McGinty, Irrgang, & Pezzullo, 2000; Yu, Kumar, Turk, & Liu, 2019). Squatting is a symmetric bi- lateral exercise, which can be used to strengthen muscles on one or both sides of the body, depending on patient needs (Luo et al., 2021). Perhaps, squat exercise can be further motivated with a reliable lower extremity exoskeleton, instead of human aids. Such exoskeletons typically employ model-based control methods as balance controller designs (Shi, Zhang, Zhang, & Ding, 2019; Xiong, 2014). Such methods, however, are not very robust against large and unexpected perturbations caused by human interactions (Luo et al., 2021). In other words, un- predictable human-exoskeleton interaction forces and perturba- tions may cause conventional balance controllers to operate un- reliably.","id":"fa17515f-ccbe-4399-b289-d7a45c7042da"}

Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) op- timization and reinforcement learning (RL) have shown promise in achieving optimized control for each individual user in the ﬁeld of wearable robots. However, HIL optimization methods lack scalability for high-dimensional space, while RL has mostly focused on optimizing robot kinematic performance. Thus, we propose a novel hierarchical framework to personalize robotic knee prosthesis control and improve overall gait performance. Speciﬁcally, in this study the framework was implemented to simultaneously design target knee kinematics and tune 12 impedance control parameters for improved symmetry of propul- sive impulse in walking. In our proposed framework, HIL optimization is used to identify an optimal target knee kinematics with respect to symmetry improvement, while RL is leveraged to yield an optimal policy for tuning impedance parameters in high- dimensional space to match the kinematics target. The proposed framework was validated on human subjects, walking with our robotic knee prosthesis. The results showed that our design successfully shaped the target knee kinematics as well as con- ﬁgured 12 impedance control parameters to improve propulsive impulse symmetry of the human users. The knee kinematics that yielded best propulsion symmetry did not preserve the normative knee kinematics proﬁle observed in non-disabled individuals, suggesting that restoration of normative joint biomechanics in walking does not necessarily optimize the gait performance of human-prosthesis systems. This new framework for prosthesis control personalization may be extended to other wearable devices or different gait performance optimization goals in the future.","id":"f1b16bf4-2859-4d99-989c-b035130bad2d"}

However, the lack of sufﬁcient labeled training samples is a huge challenge for HSI classiﬁcation. To face this challenge, we propose a semisu- pervised HSI classiﬁcation method based on graph convolutional broad network (GCBN). First, to avoid the underﬁtting problem caused by the insufﬁcient linear sparse feature representation abil- ity of broad learning system (BLS), graph convolution operation is applied to extract nonlinear and discriminative spectral-spatial features from the original HSI to replace the linear mapping features in the traditional BLS. Second, to solve the problem of insufﬁcient model classiﬁcation ability caused by limited labeled samples, the combinatorial average method (CAM) is proposed to use valuable paired samples to generate sample expansion set for GCBNmodeltraining.Third,BLSisusedtoperformbroadexpan- sion on spectral-spatial features extracted by GCN and extended byCAM,whichfurtherenhancesthefeaturerepresentationability.

The soft exosuit assists with ankle plantarflexion, hip flexion, and hip extension, equally distributing the forces between ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion. A mobile actuation system was developed to generate high assistive forces, and Bowden cables are used to transmit the forces to the exosuit. A sensor harness connects two load cells and three IMUs per leg that are used to measure real-time data for a controller that commands desired force profiles as a function of the walking cycle. In addition, a control adaptation method was developed which adjusts control parameters while walking on irregular surfaces. In preliminary studies, the proposed method substantially improved the force consistency while walking over uneven terrain. Specifically, the number of steps where the peak force deviated from the target force decreased from 100 to 57 out of 250 steps, and RMS error on the peak force decreased from 90.0 N to 76.6 N with respect to 300 N target force. Also, a two-subject case study on country-course walking demonstrated the potential of this soft exosuit to improve human energy economy while walking overground. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, lower-limb wearable devices have been developed to assist with human walking. Applications of these devices include assisting individuals with disabilities to relieve their gait deficits [1-2] and augmenting healthy people to improve the energy economy during walking [3-5] or load carriage [6-7]. Conventionally these devices have consisted of rigid structures which enables to deliver high assistive torques to the wearer and to transfer carried load directly to the ground [7]. However, when misaligned with the wearer’s biological joints, the rigid frames may restrict the natural motion of the wearer and apply undesired forces [7-8]. Moreover, rigid structures may add large inertia to the wearer’s lower limb, which is associated with increased energy expenditure during walking [9].

Young aaron.young@me.gatech.edu  A broad goal in the field of powered lower limb exoskeletons is to reduce the metabolic cost of walking. Ankle exoskeletons have successfully achieved this goal by correctly timing a plantarflexor torque during late stance phase. Hip exoskeletons have the poten- tial to assist with both flexion and extension during walking gait, but the optimal timing for maximally reducing metabolic cost is unknown. The focus of our study was to determine the best assistance timing for applying hip assistance through a pneumatic exoskeleton on human subjects. Ten non-impaired subjects walked with a powered hip exoskeleton, and both hip flexion and extension assistance were separately provided at different actuation timings using a simple burst controller. The largest average across-subject reduction in metabolic cost for hip extension was at 90% of the gait cycle (just prior to heel contact) and for hip flexion was at 50% of the gait cycle; this resulted in an 8.4 and 6.1% metabolic reduction, respectively, compared to walking with the unpowered exoskeleton. However, the ideal timing for both flexion and extension assistance varied across subjects. When selecting the assistance timing that maximally reduced metabolic cost for each subject, average metabolic cost for hip extension was 10.3% lower and hip flexion was 9.7% lower than the unpowered condition. When taking into account user preference, we found that subject preference did not correlate with metabolic cost. This indicated that user feedback was a poor method of determining the most metabolically efficient assistance power timing. The findings of this study are relevant to developers of exoskeletons that have a powered hip component to assist during human walking gait.","id":"2bc03a91-7ce8-418d-9848-59c5974e77dc"}

Murray 下肢外骨骼 实时步态相位检测","content":" Abstract— The authors intend to utilize a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance in individuals with lower limb neuromuscular deficit. The authors suggest that two foundational elements are required to do so effectively. First, the exoskeleton system must be capable of reliable real-time gait phase detection, in order to determine the nature of gait assistance to provide. Second, in gait phases or circumstances in which the exoskeleton provides minimal assistance, the passive dynamics of the exoskeleton should not hinder the individual (i.e., should have the capability to minimally interfere with gait dynamics). As such, the exoskeleton system should be capable of actively compensating for its passive dynamics, namely the inertial, gravitational, and frictional effects it imposes on the user. This paper describes the implementation of these two foundational elements (real-time gait phase detection and active cancellation of passive dynamics) on a prototype lower limb exoskeleton, and provides experimental data demonstrating their respective efficacy. I. INTRODUCTION A number of neuromuscular impairments result in acute and\/or chronic locomotor deficits. Common conditions resulting in gait deficit or impairment include incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy (CP), multiple sclerosis (MS), and complications resulting from cerebral vascular accident (stroke). There are approximately 260,000 persons in the US with SCI, approximately one half of which are incomplete injuries [1]; there are approximately 765,000 individuals in the US with CP [2]; and there are approximately 350,000 individuals in the US with MS [3]. Collectively, there are approximately 1.3 million persons in the US living with one of these conditions. Further, there are approximately 7 million persons living in the US who have experienced a cerebral vascular accident (stroke) [4], and a significant portion of these have or have had gait impairment as a result. The authors are developing a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance in individuals with lower limb neuromuscular deficit, such as individuals in those populations previously cited. Some work has been performed on treadmill and over-ground robotic devices, and their control strategies have been characterized [5, 6]. In order to use a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance, two foundational capabilities must exist.

Walsha,b,∗  aBiodesign Lab, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA bThe Wyss Institute for Biologically-Inspired Engineering, Cambridge, MA, USA  Abstract  Exoskeletons comprised of rigid load-bearing structures have been developed for many years, but a new paradigm is to create “exosuits” that apply tensile forces to the body using textiles and utilize the bodys skeletal structure to support compressive forces. Exosuits are intended to augment the musculature by providing small to moderate levels of assistance at appropriate times in the walking cycle. They have a number of substantial beneﬁts: with their fabric construction, exosuits eliminate problems of needing to align a rigid frame precisely with the biological joints and their inertia can be extremely low. In this paper, we present a fully portable hip-assistance exosuit that uses a backpack frame to attach to the torso, onto which is mounted a spooled-webbing actuator that connects to the back of the users thigh. The actuators, powered by a geared brushless motor connected to a spool via a timing belt, wind up seat-belt webbing onto the spool so that a large travel is possible with a simple, compact mechanism. Designed to be worn over the clothing, the webbing creates a large moment arm around the hip that provides torques in the sagittal plane of up to 30% of the nominal biological torques for level-ground walking. Due to its soft design, the system does not restrict the motion of the hip in the ab- and adduction directions or rotation about the leg axis. Here we present the design of the system along with some initial measurements of the system in use during walking on level ground at 1.25 m\/s, where it creates a force of up to 150 N on the thigh, equivalent to a torque of 20.5 Nm to assist hip extension.  Keywords:  exosuit, wearable robotics, walking assistance  1.  Introduction  A large number of lower limb exoskeletons have been developed over the years, usually with the pur- pose of assisting or augmenting human walking. For individuals needing to carry heavy loads such as soldiers or recreational backpackers, the promise of a mechanical assist is welcoming, potentially reduc- ing muscle fatigue, metabolic expenditure, or injury rates. For individuals needing assistance with walk- ing such as the elderly or paraplegic, or patients requiring gait rehabilitation, such devices could po- tentially restore walking function.","id":"2c7946fc-db26-4fe4-9da6-f812cdfb8367"}

Collins  Exoskeletons can enhance human mobility, but we still know little about why they are effective. For example, we do not know the relative importance of training, how much is required, or what type is most effective; how people adapt with the device; or the relative benefits of customizing assistance. We conducted experiments in which naïve users learned to walk with ankle exoskeletons under one of three training regimens characterized by differ- ent levels of variation in device behavior. Assistance was also customized for one group. After moderate-variation training, the benefits of customized assistance were large; metabolic rate was reduced by 39% compared with walking with the exoskeleton turned off. Training contributed about half of this benefit and customization about one-quarter; a generic controller reduced energy cost by 10% before training and 31% afterward. Training re- quired much more exposure than typical of exoskeleton studies, about 109 minutes of assisted walking. Type of training also had a strong effect; the low-variation group required twice as long as the moderate-variation group to become expert, and the high-variation group never acquired this level of expertise. Curiously, all users adapted in a way that resulted in less mechanical power from the exoskeleton as they gained expertise. Customizing assist- ance required less time than training for all parameters except peak torque magnitude, which grew slowly over the study, suggesting a longer time scale adaptation in the person. These results underscore the importance of training to the benefits of exoskeleton assistance and suggest the topic deserves more attention.","id":"b2c54d47-7404-4180-b18b-8f3718dacdb3"}

In addition, the framework of several BLS variants with their mathematical modeling is given. The variations include cascade, recurrent, and broad–deep combination structures.

CNN and its variants have successfully accomplished a very high recognition rate in many recognition competitions tested on ImageNet data set.

Tommaso Ranzani, Sheila Russo, & Conor Walsh School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA  ABSTRACT  Recently, there has been a growing interest in moving away from traditional rigid exoskeletons towards soft exosuits that can provide a variety of advantages including a reduction in both the weight carried by the wearer and the inertia experienced as the wearer flexes and extends their joints. These advantages are achieved by using structured functional textiles in combination with a flexible actuation scheme that enables assistive torques to be applied to the biological joints. Understanding the human- suit interface in these systems is important, as one of the key challenges with this approach is applying force to the human body in a manner that is safe, comfortable, and effective. This paper outlines a methodology for characterizing the structured functional textile of soft exosuits and then uses that methodology to evaluate several factors that lead to different suit-human series stiffnesses and pressure distributions over the body. These factors include the size of the force distribution area and the composition of the structured functional textile. Following the test results, design guidelines are suggested to maximize the safety, comfort, and efficiency of the exosuit.  INTRODUCTION  FIGURE 1.

Geberth, and Hartmut Geyer  Abstract—Variable swing-leg placement is crucial for robust and stable locomotion. While appropriate leg placement is generated in humanoid robotics by tracking pre-planned swing motions, this approach is not suitable for controlling powered limbs like prostheses, which form only part of the human-robot locomotor system. In recent work, we proposed swing controls for a double pendulum leg model that predicts variable and robust leg placement in the presence of large gait disturbances. Here we evaluate the performance of these novel controls on robotic leg testbeds. In hardware experiments we ﬁnd that the control achieves robust foot placement of anthropomorphic robotic limbs within a range of landing leg angles observed in human gait. We further observe that a version of this control that conforms with the constraints of neuromuscular dynamics generates a more human-like leg behavior at the cost of placement precision. The results suggest that the proposed controls transfer well to robotic limb systems; in particular, they may enable improved balance recovery in amputee locomotion with powered leg prostheses.  Index Terms—Legged Locomotion, Swing-Leg, Humanoid,  Prosthesis, Neuromuscular Control.  I. INTRODUCTION  LEGGED animals and robots use foot placement to bal-  ance dynamically [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. Successful foot placement ﬁrst requires the identiﬁcation of proper placement targets that stabilize locomotion, which can be obtained from simple point mass gait models in walking [6] [7] and run- ning [8] [9]. Once identiﬁed, the second task is the control of the swing-leg into these targets, which is achieved in robotic applications in several ways. Humanoid systems use centralized control strategies that pre-plan and execute full- body trajectories using inverse dynamics and kinematics [10] [11]. These strategies have enabled robots to walk [12], climb stairs [13], and react to push disturbances [14] [15]. However, they are not suited for the control of robotic limbs such as prostheses, where the robot forms only part of the locomoting system.","id":"b706dbf9-f766-43a9-9a2a-a426a0ecac6a"}

The goals of this study were to 1) systematically investigate the biomechanics of a wearer-robot system reacting to internal errors induced by a powered knee prosthesis (PKP), and 2) quantify the error tolerable bound that does not affect the user’s gait stability. Eight non-disabled participants and two unilat- eral transfemoral amputees walked on a pathway wearing a PKP, as the controller randomly switched the control parameters to disturbance parameters to mimic the errors caused by locomotion mode misrecognition. The size of prosthesiscontrolerrorswas systematicallyvariedto deter- mine the error tolerable bound that disrupted gait stabil- ity. The effect of the error was quantiﬁed based on the 1) mechanical change described by the angular impulse applied by the PKP, and 2) overall gait instability quantiﬁed using human perception, angular momentum, and compen- satory stepping. The results showed that the error tolerable bound is dependent on the gait phase and the direction of torque change. Two balance recovery strategies were also observed to allow participants to successful respond to the induced errors. The outcomes of this study may assist the future design of an auto-tuning algorithm, volitionally- controlled powered prosthetic legs, and training of gait stability.

The distance during dermoskeleton was moderately to highly valued by participants during the laboratory tests. While the results from this pilot study suggest a potential for dermoskeletal technology in improving mobility in persons with MS, additional tests in a community setting are now required to quantify the efficacy and safety of the innovation as well as how the tested device can be used in daily activities, and more broadly improve the quality of life of its users.  a pilot study if such technology could also be useful as a means to improve endurance in persons with muscle weakness due to central nervous system lesions.","id":"9268234d-f8b3-479e-b6d0-0283a14bf1ce"}

To achieve greater gains in the future it will be important to determine optimal actuation parameters and explore the effect of assisting other joints. The aim of the present work is to investigate how the timing of hip extension assistance affects the positive mechanical power delivered by an exosuit and its effect on biological joint power and metabolic cost during loaded walking. In this study, we evaluated 4 different hip assistive profiles with different actuation timings: early-start-early-peak (ESEP), early-start-late-peak (ESLP), late-start-early-peak (LSEP), late-start-late-peak (LSLP). Methods: Eight healthy participants walked on a treadmill at a constant speed of 1.5 m · s-1 while carrying a 23 kg backpack load.

Panizzolo, Conor Walsh, Member, IEEE  Abstract—In this paper we describe an IMU-based iterative controller for hip extension assistance where the onset timing of assistance is based on an estimate of the maximum hip flexion angle. The controller was implemented on a mono-articular soft exosuit coupled to a lab-based multi-joint actuation platform that enables rapid reconfiguration of different sensors and control strategy implementation. The controller design is motivated by a model of the suit-human interface and utilizes an iterative control methodology that includes gait detection and step-by-step actuator position profile generation to control the onset timing, peak timing, and peak magnitude of the delivered force. This controller was evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.5 m\/s while carrying a load of 23 kg. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across subjects. Specifically, for a given profile, the average delivered force started concurrently with the timing of the maximum hip flexion angle and reached its peak timing 22.7 ± 0.63% later in the gait cycle (desired 23%) with a peak magnitude of 198.2 ± 1.6 N (desired 200 N), equivalent to an average peak torque of 30.5 ± 4.7 Nm. This control approach was used to assess the metabolic effect of four different assistive profiles. Metabolic reductions ranging from 5.7% to 8.5% were found when comparing the powered conditions with the unpowered condition. This work enables studies to assess the biomechanical and physiological responses to different assistive profiles to determine the optimal hip extension assistance during walking.  I.

Walsh1,2*  , Sangjun Lee1,2, Simona Crea4, Christopher Siviy1,2, Fabricio Saucedo1,2, Ignacio Galiana1,2,  Abstract  Background: Only very recently, studies have shown that it is possible to reduce the metabolic rate of unloaded and loaded walking using robotic ankle exoskeletons. Some studies obtained this result by means of high positive work assistance while others combined negative and positive work assistance. There is no consensus about the isolated contribution of negative work assistance. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to examine the effect of varying negative work assistance at the ankle joint while maintaining a fixed level of positive work assistance with a multi-articular soft exosuit. Methods: We tested eight participants during walking at 1.5 ms−1 with a 23-kg backpack. Participants wore a version of the exosuit that assisted plantarflexion via Bowden cables tethered to an off-board actuation platform. In four active conditions we provided different rates of exosuit bilateral ankle negative work assistance ranging from 0. 015 to 0.037 W kg−1 and a fixed rate of positive work assistance of 0.19 W kg−1. Results: All active conditions significantly reduced metabolic rate by 11 to 15% compared to a reference condition, where the participants wore the exosuit but no assistance was provided. We found no significant effect of negative work assistance. However, there was a trend (p = .08) toward greater reduction in metabolic rate with increasing negative work assistance, which could be explained by observed reductions in biological ankle and hip joint power and moment.  Conclusions: The non-significant trend of increasing negative work assistance with increasing reductions in metabolic rate motivates the value in further studies on the relative effects of negative and positive work assistance. There may be benefit in varying negative work over a greater range or in isolation from positive work assistance.","id":"9ed49892-ed7f-44d8-9ee0-ada434ada421"}

Few studies have reported the biomechanical aspects of stair climbing for this ergonomically demanding task. The pur- pose of this ethically approved study was to identify normal functional parameters of the lower limb during stair climbing and to com- pare the actions of stair ascent and descent in young healthy individuals.  Methods. Thirty-three young healthy subjects, (16 M, 17 F, range 18–39 years) participated in the study. The laboratory staircase consisted of four steps (rise height 18 cm, tread length 28.5 cm). Kinematic data were recorded using 3D motion analysis system. Tem- poral gait cycle data and ground reaction forces were recorded using a force platform. Kinetic data were standardized to body mass and height.  Findings. Paired-samples t tests showed signiﬁcantly greater hip and knee angles (mean diﬀerence standard deviation (SD): hip 28.10 (SD 4.08), knee 3.39 (SD 7.20)) and hip and knee moments (hip 0.25 N m\/kg (SD 0.18), knee 0.17 N m\/kg (SD 0.15)) during stair ascent compared to descent. Signiﬁcantly greater ankle dorsiﬂexion angles (9.90 (SD 3.80)) and plantarﬂexion angles (8.78 (SD 4.80)) were found during stair descent compared to ascent. Coeﬃcient of variation (mean (SD)) in percentage between repeated tests varied for joint angles and moments, respectively (2.35% (SD 1.83)–17.53% (SD 13.62)) and (4.65% (SD 2.99)–40.73% (SD 24.77)).  Interpretation. Stair ascent was shown to be the more demanding biomechanical task when compared to stair descent for healthy young subjects.

Bartlett, J. Alex Heller, Mozziyar Etemadi, Aaron Young, Thomas Pl¨otz, and Omer T. Inan, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Objective: To estimate instantaneous oxygen uptake (VO2) with a small, low-cost wearable sensor during exercise and daily activities in order to enable monitoring of energy expenditure (EE) in uncontrolled settings. We aim to do so using a combination of seismocardiogram (SCG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and atmospheric pressure (AP) signals obtained from a minimally obtrusive wearable device. Methods: In this study, sub- jects performed a treadmill protocol in a controlled environment and an outside walking protocol in an uncontrolled environment. During testing, the COSMED K5 metabolic system collected gold standard breath-by-breath (BxB) data and a custom-built wearable patch placed on the mid-sternum collected SCG, ECG and AP signals. We extracted features from these signals to estimate the BxB VO2 data obtained from the COSMED system. Results: In estimating instantaneous VO2, we achieved our best results on the treadmill protocol using a combination of SCG (frequency) and AP features (RMSE of 3.68±0.98 ml\/kg\/min and R2 of 0.77). For the outside protocol, we achieved our best results using a combination of SCG (frequency), ECG and AP features (RMSE of 4.3±1.47 ml\/kg\/min and R2 of 0.64). In estimating VO2 consumed over one minute intervals during the protocols, our median percentage error was 15.8% for the treadmill protocol and 20.5% for the outside protocol. Conclusion: SCG, ECG and AP signals from a small wearable patch can enable accurate estimation of instantaneous VO2 in both controlled and uncontrolled settings. SCG signals capturing variation in cardio-mechanical processes, AP signals, and state of the art machine learning models contribute signiﬁcantly to the accurate estimation of instantaneous VO2. Signiﬁcance: Accurate estimation of VO2 with a low cost, minimally obtrusive wearable patch can enable the monitoring of VO2 and EE in everyday settings and make the many applications of these measurements more accessible to the general public.","id":"a756aa04-61d9-4a28-bb0b-b8174c86d9ce"}

Hargrove, Member, IEEE,  and Todd A. Kuiken, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Robotic ankle prostheses can imitate the biomechanical function of intact legs at the cost of a larger weight and size compared to conventional passive prostheses. Unfortunately, increased weight and size neg- atively affect comfort and socket stability, ultimately lim- iting their clinical viability. Alternatively, a nonbackdrivable transmissionsystemcanbeusedtoactivelyregulatethean- kle position during nonweight bearing activities only. This semiactive design can be made smaller and lighter as a re- sult of the lower actuation power requirements. However, the transmission system must withstand high loads during stance and standing. Thus, available semiactive prostheses are still signiﬁcantly heavier and have a larger build height than passive ankle prostheses. In this paper, we present the design, development, and validation of a semiactive an- kle prosthesis with a nonbackdrivable cam-follower mech- anism designed to lower the load on moving components and align with the foot longitudinally as necessary to reduce the prosthesis weight and size. The proposed ankle mech- anism is ∼50% shorter, has ∼40% wider range of motion (ROM), and is estimated to be ∼27% lighter than available semiactive prostheses. Experiments with a transtibial sub- ject show that the semiactive prosthesis can increase foot clearance up to 142% and reduce the load on the residual limb as low as 32% compared to passive prostheses.

Villarreal, Student Member, IEEE, Hasan A. Poonawala, Member, IEEE and Robert D. Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—The phase of human gait is difﬁcult to quantify accurately in the presence of disturbances. In contrast, recent bipedal robots use time-independent controllers relying on a mechanical phase variable to synchronize joint patterns through the gait cycle. This concept has inspired studies to determine if human joint patterns can also be parameterized by a mechanical variable. Although many phase variable candidates have been proposed, it remains unclear which, if any, provide a robust representation of phase for human gait analysis or control. In this paper we analytically derive an ideal phase variable (the hip phase angle) that is provably monotonic and bounded throughout the gait cycle. To examine the robustness of this phase variable, ten able-bodied human subjects walked over a platform that randomly applied phase-shifting perturbations to the stance leg. A statistical analysis found the correlations between nominal and perturbed joint trajectories to be signiﬁcantly greater when parameterized by the hip phase angle (0.95+) than by time or a different phase variable. The hip phase angle also best parameterized the transient errors about the nominal periodic interlimb phasing was best explained by local orbit. Finally, (ipsilateral) hip phase angles that are synchronized during the double-support period.  Index Terms—Phase, human gait, perturbations, nonlinear  dynamics and control  I.

The neural circuitry that facilitates automaticity is impaired by stroke, resulting in a compensatory shift toward executive-control, as well as reduced paretic propulsion and increased step-to-step variability. We have developed a soft robotic exosuit to augment paretic propulsion by providing paretic plantarflexor assistance during the propulsive phase of walking. For this preliminary study, we hypothesized that changes in walking automaticity would accompany changes in paretic propulsion. When plantarflexor assistance timings were tuned to reduce propulsion variability—a biomechanical measure of automaticity—a -14.7±2.5% variability reduction was accompanied by increased paretic propulsion (%Δ:+6.4±6.3%) and prefrontal cortex activity (Δ oxygenated hemoglobin:+1.08E-04±1.05E-04 M mm).

INTRODUCTION Human locomotor control ranges on a spectrum of automaticity; highly automatic control strategies require minimal cognitive resources, while executive control strategies are attention-demanding. The neural circuitry that enables walking automaticity largely consists of cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord; in contrast, executive control depends heavily on cortical brain regions, and more specifically, the prefrontal cortex.

We demonstrate that the pressurized actuators can generate motion and force comparable to natural human ﬁngers through bench- top testing. We apply textile-elastomer capacitive sensors to the glove to track ﬁnger ﬂexion via strain and detect contact with objects via force. Intuitive user control is achieved via a state machine controller based on signals from the integrated sensors to detect relative changes in hand-object interactions. Results from an initial evaluation with 3 participants with spinal cord injury (SCI), of varied injury levels and years since injury, wearing and controlling the glove show an average of 87% improvement in grasping force, and improvements in functional assessments for participants with recent injuries. A signiﬁcant variation in response suggests further investigation is required to understand the adaptation needed across different injury levels and durations since injury. Additionally, we evaluate the controller and ﬁnd an average of 3 seconds from user initiations to completed grasps, and 10% inadvertent grasp triggers and no false releases when objects are held.  I.

We expected powered conditions to provide large improvements in energy economy and for spring-like patterns to provide smaller benefits achievable with simpler devices. We used human-in-the-loop optimization to attempt to identify the best exoskeleton characteristics for each device type and individual user, allowing for a well-controlled comparison.

Karen Liu2  Abstract—This paper introduces a new planning algorithm to minimize the damage of humanoid falls by utilizing multiple contact points. Given an unstable initial state of the robot, our approach plans for the optimal sequence of contact points such that the initial momentum is dissipated with minimal impacts on the robot. Instead of switching among a collection of individual control strategies, we propose a general algorithm which plans for appropriate responses to a wide variety of falls, from a single step to recover a gentle nudge, to a rolling motion to break a high-speed fall. Our algorithm transforms the falling problem into a sequence of inverted pendulum problems and use dynamic programming to solve the optimization efﬁciently. The planning algorithm is validated in physics simulation and experimentally tested on a BioloidGP humanoid.  I.

INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, various types of exoskeletons have been developed to perform various tasks, ranging from lifting of heavy loads to aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals. Recently, efforts have been made to adapt them to the needs of public users such as elderly and infirm people. Using such a device to assist their walk or movements enables them to lead more active and independent lives. However, when compared with a device for the disabled who are completely dependent on an assistive device, the device for the general elderly and infirm people has to satisfy more stringent performance standards, such as higher assistive performance, better wearability, and lower product weight. In addition, the device should be able to provide a new user experience. Wearability and usability are the main issues with traditional exoskeleton mechanisms, which are usually composed of rigid frames with straps and are fitted at a certain location on the body [1-4]. With rigid frames, such a mechanism can support its own weight, and additional loads such as the weight of the wearer and the objects carried by him\/her. It can transmit the assisting torque from the actuator to the wearer’s body. On the other hand, its structure cannot be tightly fitted to the wearer’s lower body because of the rigid frames. It is too heavy and bulky, resulting in the high energy cost. Moreover, it also affects the natural gait dynamics and kinematics of the user. As an alternative to rigid exoskeletons, active soft orthotic systems [5-7] which can be tightly fitted to the wearer’s body have been developed. As compared to the traditional exoskeletons, these systems provide minimal mechanical impedance and kinematic restrictions.

Different computational processing models were developed for the user and the unit. A processing method was proposed in which inverse dynamics analysis is used to calculate the assist moment from user processing and the system weight compensation from unit processing. A floor reaction force for the system weight compensation processing method was established to allow system weight compensation control. A high degree of stability in the vector orientation of the floor reaction force for system weight compensation was shown in tests. In addition, this method enables estimation of the user’s floor reaction force vector by applying the user’s dynamics model. Thus, it was shown that there are good prospects for the realization of a user-friendly walking assist system that does not employ floor reaction force sensors in the system.  1. Introduction  It is predicted that the aging of Japanese society will continue to increase in pace in the future. The elderly tend to withdraw from participation in society when they begin to lose confidence in their health or physical strength(1). Taking this social background into consideration, Honda is seeking to contribute to supporting the lives of the elderly by conducting research on a wearable walking assist system that reduces the load on the body during movement. Prioritizing the comfort of the user, the goal of the research is to realize a “user-friendly walking assist system.” Research to date has focused on enabling the motion of the system to follow the user’s intentions, and has sketched an outline of a system using a proposed joint moment assist method that estimates joint moment as the user is moving and provides assist power depending on the estimated joint moment(2).  In an attempt to increase the user-friendliness of the system, the goal of the research discussed in this paper was to help prevent the user from having to support the  weight of the system, through the development of a new control method that enables the weight of the system to be compensated at the same time as assist is provided to the user.  2.

Agrawal1,3  Accepted: 5 December 2017  Published: xx xx xxxx  Gait and balance disorders are major problems that contribute to falls among subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Strengthening the compensatory responses through the use of balance perturbations may improve balance in PD. To date, it is unclear how PD affects the ability to react and adapt to perturbations delivered while walking. This study aims to investigate how PD affects the ability to walk, respond to balance perturbations, and produce acute short-term effects to improve compensatory reactions and gait stability. A cable-driven robot was used to train nine patients with PD and nine age-matched controls with multidirectional waist-pull perturbations while walking on a treadmill. Margin of stability and base of support were evaluated while walking without cables and reacting to the perturbations. PD was associated with a reduced stability in the forward direction and the inability to produce proactive anticipatory adjustments. Both groups were able to improve the response to the disturbances and produce short-term aftereffects of increased gait stability once the cables were removed. A single session of perturbation-based balance training produced acute effects that ameliorated gait instability in PD. This result is encouraging for designing new therapeutic interventions that remediate falls risk.  Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results primarily from a progressive loss of substan- tia nigra neurons within the basal ganglia that produce dopamine, an important neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of movement1. Individuals with PD commonly experience gait and balance disorders which contribute to falls, mobility loss, reduced independence and quality of life2–4. Balance impairment is difficult to treat with dopaminergic medication, which suggests a contribution by non-dopaminergic lesions5. In some cases, exercise and motor training can improve the performance of balance-related activities3. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that these improvements translate into prevention of falls3. This may be due to the fact that current training meth- ods fail to target the specific neuromuscular skills required for fall prevention6.","id":"a4c37db9-d36a-4fa5-8d39-1ff833e33dab"}

To conquer these challenges, after many iterations and in- depth investigations, we have meticulously developed a full-size humanoid robot, “Adam”, whose innovative structural design greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the imitation learning process. In addition, we have developed a novel imita- tion learning framework based on an adversarial motion prior, which applies not only to Adam but also to humanoid robots in general. Using the framework, Adam can exhibit unprecedented human-like characteristics in locomotion tasks. Our experimen- tal results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables Adam to achieve human-comparable performance in complex locomotion tasks, marking the first time that human locomotion data has been used for imitation learning in a full-size humanoid robot.

Previous research studies on human-robot interaction and biomechanics have largely been performed with rigid exoskeletons that add significant lower extremities and provide constraints to the wearer’s natural kinematics in both actuated and non-actuated degrees of freedom. Actuated lightweight soft exosuits minimize these effects and provide a unique opportunity to study human-robot interaction in wearable systems without affecting the subjects underlying natural dynamics. In this paper, we present the design and control of a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide biologically realistic torques to ankle, knee, and hip joints through lower extremity soft exosuits. Two different soft exosuits have been designed to deliver assistive forces through Bowden cable transmission to the ankle and hip joints. Through human subject experiments, it is demonstrated that with a real- time admittance controller, accurate force profile tracking can be achieved during walking. The average energy delivered to the test subject was calculated while walking at 1.25 m\/s and actuated with 15% of the total torque required by the biological joints. The results show that the ankle joint received an average of 3.02J during plantar flexion and that the hip joint received 1.67J during flexion each gait cycle.

Due to the rigid linkages, joints misalignments, the traditional rigid exoskeletons constrain the biological joints of the actuated and non-actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs), which leads to deviation from the wearer’s natural motion, discomfort or injuries[15, 16]. Moreover, an additional consequence is that a wearer will typically expend an increased amount of energy to complete a desired motion (e.g. walking).

Martinez-Hernandez,3 H. Kim,3 S. K. Agrawal1,3*  Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science. No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Children with cerebral palsy commonly exhibit an abnormality called crouch gait, which is characterized by exces- sive flexion of the hips\/knees and weak plantar flexor muscles during the stance phase. One of the major reasons for this pathological gait is weakness in soleus muscles. During the mid-stance phase of gait when the toe and heel are both on the ground, the soleus keeps the shank upright and facilitates extension of the knee angle. It also provides propulsive forces on the body during the late stance phase of the gait cycle. We hypothesized that walk- ing with downward pelvic pull will (i) strengthen extensor muscles, especially the soleus, against the applied downward force and (ii) improve muscle coordination during walking. We then tested a robotic training paradigm to improve both posture and gait of children with crouch gait. In this paradigm, participants with crouch gait were subjected to downward pelvic force when walking on a treadmill, provided by a cable-driven robot called Tethered Pelvic Assist Device. Electromyography of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles and walking kinematics of the partici- pants showed the feasibility of this training, enhanced upright posture of the participants, and improved muscle coordination. In addition, walking features of these participants, such as increased step length, range of motion of the lower limb angles, toe clearance, and heel-to-toe pattern, improved. This robotic training method can be a promising intervention for children with cerebral palsy who have a crouch gait.  INTRODUCTION In the United States, 3.6 children out of every 1000 school-aged chil- dren have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) (1). These children show abnormal gait patterns, for example, jump gait, equinus gait, and crouch gait (2, 3). The crouch gait is characterized by excessive flexion of the hips, knees, or ankles (2, 4, 5). Children with crouch have slow walking speed, reduced range of motion of the joints (ROM), small step length, large body sway, and absence of a heel strike (6). In addition to other complications, crouch gait increases the energy cost of walking, causes pain, and results in joint degeneration over time (7).","id":"c1b9d70d-d598-46de-9927-e5bdad3bc64f"}

The off-board system consists an actuation unit with two degrees of freedom that can transmit forces to our soft exosuit via Bowden cables. To perform accurate force tracking and cable slack management, we implemented a switching admittance-position control approach that utilizes the advantages of both admittance and position control. In particular, feedforward models (FFMs) are added to the admittance control to compensate variability of individual kinematics, nonlinear hip exosuit stiffness and actuator transmission loss to enable a more accurate force tracking. This system allows us to track force profiles accurately and robustly under normal walking or jogging speed. The performance of force tracking was evaluated on three subjects walking on a treadmill at 1.25 m\/s with various magnitude, shape, and timings of assistive profiles and jogging on a treadmill at 2.3 m\/s with varied magnitude of a representative assistance profile. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across different profiles. In case of walking experiments, the errors of the magnitude, RMS-E, and timing were within 2.0 N, 8.4 N, and 1.8% when varying the magnitude, shape, and timing respectively. In case of jogging experiments, the RMS-E was within 3.0 N. This system will be used for future research examining how to individualize assistive profiles for different wearers during walking and jogging. I. INTRODUCTION In the past decades, lower-limb exoskeletons have been drawing intense research interest because of their potential applications to assist or augment human performances for various purposes. Some of the exoskeletons are designed to support and train a paraplegic’s body [1]–[7], while others improve the walking efficiency of able-bodied individuals, especially in case of load-carrying [8]–[11]. The majority of these devices consist of rigid structures, which are favorable for supporting the carried load or body weight and producing high assistive force to the wearer. However, the rigid nature can interfere natural movement of the wearer when the exoskeleton joints are misaligned with biological joints or the degree of freedom are not supported [12]–[14].

Thomas, Member, IEEE, Nikhil V. Divekar, Student Member, IEEE,  Vamsi Peddinti, Robert D. Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Various backdrivable lower-limb exoskeletons have demonstrated the electromechanical capability to assist volitional motions of able-bodied users and people with mild to moderate gait disorders, but there does not exist a control framework that can be deployed on any joint(s) to assist any activity of daily life in a provably stable manner. This paper presents the modular, multi-task optimal energy shaping (M-TOES) frame- work, which uses a convex, data-driven optimization to train an analytical control model to instantaneously estimate assistive joint torques across activities for any lower-limb exoskeleton joint configuration. The presented modular energy basis is sufficiently descriptive to fit normative human joint torques (given norma- tive feedback from signals available to a given joint configu- ration) across sit-stand transitions, stair ascent\/descent, ramp ascent\/descent, and level walking at different speeds. We evalu- ated controllers for four joint configurations (unilateral\/bilateral, hip\/knee) of the modular M-BLUE exoskeleton on eight able- bodied users navigating a multi-activity course comprising the primary activities of daily life. The two unilateral conditions significantly lowered overall muscle activation across all tasks and subjects (p < 0.001). In contrast, bilateral configurations had a minimal impact, possibly attributable to device weight and physical constraints.  Index Terms—Robotics, optimization, passivity-based control.  I.

A human augmentation approach based on the application of bio- mechatronics and artificial intelligence, and referred to as the “Dermoskeleton” concept or Knee Stress Release Device (KSRD™), aims to address the distributed weight overload challenge. This device attaches to the outer sections of both legs and provides assistance during walking. This report describes a user evaluation of the KSRD™ beta version using regular force members of the Canadian Forces. Results suggest that the KSRD™ beta version performance improves as more load is added onto the soldier. The addition of the KSRD™ beta version produced similar physiological effects as adding weight to the participants’ total load. Several recommendations are provided with respect to future studies involving future versions of the KSRD™.  INTRODUCTION The typical weight burden of dismounted soldiers  often exceeds 40 kg, i.e. more than 50% of the body weight, which is much beyond the recommended human factor safe load limits (Bedard, Tack, Pageau, Ricard, and Rittenhouse, 2011). This produces a significant strain on the musculoskeletal system in order to transport these loads over long distances. During a three year period from January 2004 to December 2007, of all the medical evacuations from both Iraq and Afghanistan, 31% were due to musculoskeletal, connective tissue, or spinal cord injuries, which excessive weight carried by soldiers is a contributing factor. Of these injuries, more than 80% of the soldiers never returned to combat (Bernton, 2011).","id":"3920859c-d009-4edc-8c8b-8d67f110d4b0"}

Journal of Experimental Biology • Accepted manuscript  Summary statement  A soft robotic exosuit designed to assist the paretic limb during walking can induce more symmetrical body  center of mass power generation by the paretic and nonparetic limbs and reduce metabolic power  consumption during hemiparetic walking.  Abstract  Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically asymmetric and metabolically expensive. Weakness  and impaired control of the paretic ankle contribute to reduced forward propulsion and ground clearance—  walking subtasks critical for safe and efficient locomotion. Targeted gait interventions that improve paretic  ankle function after stroke are therefore warranted. We have developed textile-based, soft wearable robots  that transmit mechanical power generated by off-board or body-worn actuators to the paretic ankle using  Bowden cables (soft exosuits) and have demonstrated the exosuits can overcome deficits in paretic limb  forward propulsion and ground clearance, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking.  This study elucidates the biomechanical mechanisms underlying exosuit-induced reductions in metabolic  power. We evaluated the relationships between exosuit-induced changes in the body center of mass (COM)  power generated by each limb, individual joint powers, and metabolic power. Compared to walking with  an exosuit unpowered, exosuit assistance produced more symmetrical COM power generation during the  critical period of the step-to-step transition (22.4±6.4% more symmetric).

Robertson, Jean-Marie J. Wilson, and Taunya A. St. Pierre University of Ottawa  The purpose of this research was to determine the functions of the gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles about their associated joints during full (deep-knee) squats. Muscle func- tion was determined from joint kinematics, inverse dynamics, electromyography, and muscle length changes. The subjects were six experienced, male weight lifters. Analyses revealed that the prime movers during ascent were the monoarticular gluteus maximus and vasti muscles (as exemplified by vastus latera- lis) and to a lesser extent the soleus muscles. The biarticular muscles functioned mainly as stabilizers of the ankle, knee, and hip joints by working eccentrically to control descent or transferring energy among the segments during ascent. During the ascent phase, the hip exten- sor moments of force produced the largest powers followed by the ankle plantar flexors and then the knee extensors. The hip and knee extensors provided the initial bursts of power during ascent with the ankle extensors and especially a second burst from the hip exten- sors adding power during the latter half of the ascent.  Keywords: electromyography, inverse dynam- ics, kinesiology  Traditionally, kinesiologists and physical educators classify muscles in several ways: by anatomical func- tion, by type of contraction, by level of recruitment, and by work done by the muscle during a particular motion.

In this paper, we propose a myoelectric controller for a robotic transtib- ial prosthesis to realize adaptive slope walking. It works together with the intrinsic controller, enabling amputee users to pay rela- tively less attention on myoelectric control during walking. Am- putee users convey the information of ground slope to prostheses by consciously performing dorsiﬂexion and plantar ﬂexion of the “phantom ankle” with different intensities at the beginning of the swing phase. Two channels of surface electromyographic signals are measured from the residual shank, and they are mapped to the inclination angle of the slope. Control parameters of the in- trinsic controller are then calculated according to the estimated inclination angle. In this preliminary study, two transtibial am- putee subjects were recruited. They were asked to convey six tar- geted inclination angles ( ± 5◦, ±10◦, and ±15◦) to the prosthesis with the trained myoelectric controller during level-ground walk- ing, and satisfactory control performance was achieved.

As ambulation requires power generation and active control of movements, the passive nature of most available leg prostheses is a major cause of the observed deﬁcits. Powered prostheses aim to address this limita- tion using battery-operated servomotors.

In addition, they can provide stance yielding as necessary for descending stairs and ramps.

Received: 9 August 2018; Accepted: 8 September 2018; Published: 11 September 2018    Abstract: Exoskeleton robots demonstrate promise in their application in assisting or enhancing human physical capacity. Joint muscular torques (JMT) reﬂect human effort, which can be applied on an exoskeleton robot to realize an active power-assist function. The estimation of human JMT with a wearable exoskeleton is challenging. This paper proposed a novel human lower limb JMT estimation method based on the inverse dynamics of the human body. The method has two main parts: the inverse dynamic approach (IDA) and the sensing system. We solve the inverse dynamics of each human leg separately to shorten the serial chain and reduce computational complexity, and divide the JMT into the mass-induced one and the foot-contact-force (FCF)-induced one to avoid switching the dynamic equation due to different contact states of the feet. An exoskeleton embedded sensing system is designed to obtain the user’s motion data and FCF required by the IDA by mapping motion information from the exoskeleton to the human body. Compared with the popular electromyography (EMG) and wearable sensor based solutions, electrodes, sensors, and complex wiring on the human body are eliminated to improve wearing convenience. A comparison experiment shows that this method produces close output to a motion analysis system with different subjects in different motion.

Such a side effect causes unnatural posture and additional effort for the wearer to maintain the body balance. To minimize the side effect, this paper proposes a control method of an exoskeletal robot to assist a certain target motion with body weight support and balance maintenance functions at the same time. The exoskeletal robot used in this study measures the center of pressure on the wearer’s feet in real-time using air pressure sensors embedded in the soles of the shoes. Then the proposed control method determines the direction of the assistive force to assist the wearers balancing. The desired assistance torque required for realizing the proposed assistance method is precisely generated by series elastic actuators installed at the hip and knee joints of the exoskeletal robot. In the experiments, an assistance effect is veriﬁed by measuring the EMG signals of the six lower-limb muscles that are mainly involved in the target movement. This paper also introduces the experimental results that show the proposed assistive method reduces the EMG signal in ﬁve muscles, and reduces the variation of the COP movement compared to the case where only the body weight support method is applied in the control of the exoskeletal robot. These demonstrate that the proposed assistance method effectively assists in balancing and body weight supporting effectively.

Here we show that exoskeleton optimization can be performed rapidly and under real-world conditions. We designed a portable ankle exoskeleton based on insights from tests with a versatile laboratory testbed. We developed a data-driven method for optimizing exoskeleton assistance outdoors using wearable sensors and found that it was equally effective as laboratory methods, but identified optimal parameters four times faster. We performed real-world optimization using data collected during many short bouts of walking at varying speeds. Assistance optimized during one hour of naturalistic walking in a public setting increased self-selected speed by 9 ± 4% and reduced the energy used to travel a given distance by 17 ± 5% compared with normal shoes. This assistance reduced metabolic energy consumption by 23 ± 8% when participants walked on a treadmill at a standard speed of 1.5 m s−1. Human movements encode information that can be used to personalize assistive devices and enhance performance.  Exoskeletons that assist leg movement show promise for enhancing personal mobility but have yet to provide real-world benefits. Millions of people have mobility impairments that make walking slower5 and more fatiguing6, while millions more people have occupations that require strenuous locomotion7. In research laboratories, exoskele- tons can increase walking speed1,8,9 and reduce the energy required to walk2–4,10–16, but these benefits have not yet translated to real-world conditions17. Providing beneficial assistance in the real world is difficult for several reasons: the specialized equipment used to personalize assistance is not available outside the laboratory; unlike walking on a treadmill, everyday walking occurs in many bouts of varying speed and duration; and devices must be self-contained and easy to use. In this study, we addressed each of these challenges to demonstrate effective exoskeleton assistance under naturalistic conditions.","id":"9716b96f-b630-4671-8d08-543a97fc4e83"}

Our approach combines the concepts of machine learning and musculoskeletal modeling. Methods: We compared our novel design with a musculoskeletal model (MM) and 2 continuous EMG decoders based on artificial neural networks (ANNs): multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and nonlinear autoregressive neural networks with exogenous inputs (NARX networks). EMG and joint kinematics data were collected from 10 non-disabled and 1 transradial amputee subject. The offline performance tested across 3 different conditions (i.e. varied arm postures, shifted electrode locations, and noise-contaminated EMG signals) and online performance for a virtual postural matching task was quantified. Finally, we implemented the N2M2 to operate a prosthetic hand and tested functional task performance. Results: The N2M2 made more accurate predictions than the MLP in all postures and electrode locations (p<0.003). For estimated MCP joint angles, the N2M2 was less sensitive to noisy EMG signals than the MM or NARX network with respect to error (p<0.032) as well as the NARX network with respect to correlation (p=0.007). Additionally, the N2M2 had better online task performance than the NARX network (p≤0.030). Conclusion: Overall, we have found that combining the concepts of machine learning and musculoskeletal modeling has resulted in a more robust joint kinematics decoder than either concept individually. Significance: The outcome of this study may result in a novel, highly reliable controller for powered prosthetic hands.

Given that most activities of daily living necessitate the simultaneous coordinated interaction of numerous muscle groups, the squat is considered one of the best exercises for improving quality of life because of its ability to recruit multiple muscle groups in a single maneuver (22). The squatting movement has close speciﬁcity to many everyday tasks (such as lifting packages and picking up children), as well as having an indirect correlation to count- less other chores and hobbies.  The squat also is becoming increasingly popular in clinical settings as a means to strengthen lower-body muscles and connective tissue after joint-related injury. It has been used extensively for therapeutic treatment of ligament lesions, patellofemoral dysfunctions, total joint replacement, and ankle instability (14,56). Moreover, the closed-chain stance required for performance reduces anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strain (64), making it superior to the knee extension for rehabilitation of ACL injury (21,65).","id":"b78970cd-97cc-4ef6-865a-24e29bc484d3"}

Methods: The classification method employs a phase-variable description of gait, and identifies a given activity based on the expected curvature characteristics of that activity over a gait cycle. The classification method was tested in experiments conducted with seven healthy subjects performing three different locomotor activities: level ground walking, stair descent, and stair ascent. Classification accuracy of the phase variable classification method was assessed for classifying each activity, and transitions between activities, and compared to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier as a benchmark. Results: For the subjects tested, the phase variable classification method outperformed LDA when using non-subject- specific training data, while the LDA outperformed the phase variable approach when using training. Conclusions: The proposed method may provide improved classification accuracy for gait classification applications trained with non-subject-specific data.

The multi-disc brake provides resistive torque through a stack of friction discs which are compressed by a dc-motor-driven ball screw. Unlike nearly all other proportional brakes, which operate in a normally unlocked mode, the brake presented here is designed such that it may be configured in either a normally unlocked or normally locked mode. The latter enables lower electrical energy consumption and added safety in the event of electrical power failure in certain applications. Following the device description, experimental data is presented to characterize the performance of the brake. The performance characteristics are subsequently compared to those of a commercially available magnetic particle brake of comparable size. I. INTRODUCTION everal control applications require the use of an electrically controllable proportional rotary brake (e.g., [1]-[16]). Probably the most common and thoroughly developed example of such a device is the magnetic particle brake (MPB). Magnetic particle brakes produce a steady-state resistive torque roughly proportional to the input current. A sectioned view of a magnetic particle brake is shown in Figure 1. DC current applied to the brake coil induces a magnetic field which links fine ferrite particles to the rotating brake shaft. The amount of current in the coil determines the strength of the magnetic field, which in turn determines the resistive torque imposed on the brake shaft. Compared with the closed-loop control of a high-performance DC torque motor, these devices provide a relatively low-power and light-weight means of exerting controlled dissipative mechanical torque. Further, using an electric motor as a dissipater requires measurement of velocity, which typically contains phase lag, which in turn adds (rather than dissipates) energy to the system. A proportional brake, on the other hand, does not require velocity measurement and is guaranteed to be energetically passive. Though the weight of a magnetic particle brake is low relative to a DC motor (for a given resistive torque), in many cases the weight remains significant","id":"609e9e09-a714-4fc1-bece-941ab5dbeefd"}

The orthosis and control structure was experimentally implemented on a paraplegic subject (T10 complete) in order to provide a preliminary characterization of its capability to provide basic walking. Data and video is presented from these initial trials, which indicates that the orthosis and controller are able to effectively provide walking within parallel bars at an average speed of 0.8 km\/hr.

Introduction  THERE are currently about 262,000 spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals in the United States, with roughly 12,000 new injuries sustained each year at an average age of injury of 40.2 years [1]. Of these, at least 44% (at least 5300 cases per year) result in paraplegia. One of the most significant impairments resulting from paraplegia is the loss of mobility, particularly given the relatively young (average) age at which such injuries occur. Surveys of persons with paraplegia indicate that mobility concerns are among the most prevalent [2], and that chief among mobility desires is the ability to walk and stand [3]. In addition to impaired mobility, the inability to stand and walk entails severe physiological effects, including muscular atrophy, loss of bone mineral content, frequent skin breakdown problems, increased incidence of urinary tract infection, muscle spasticity, impaired lymphatic and vascular circulation, impaired digestive operation, and reduced respiratory and cardiovascular capacities [4].","id":"b7f6232d-0385-4cd8-bc80-d75ec62bd8fa"}

Sawicki∗ and Nabil S. Khan  Abstract—Goal: A recent experiment demonstrated that when humans wear unpowered elastic ankle exoskeletons with inter- mediate spring stiffness, they can reduce their metabolic energy cost to walk by ∼7%. Springs that are too compliant or too stiff have little beneﬁt. The purpose of this study was to use model- ing and simulation to explore the muscle-level mechanisms for the “sweet spot” in stiffness during exoskeleton assisted walking. Methods: We developed a simple lumped uniarticular muscu- loskeletal model of the plantarﬂexors operating in parallel with an elastic “exo-tendon.” Using an inverse approach with constrained kinematics and kinetics, we rapidly simulated human walking over a range of exoskeleton stiffness values and examined the underly- ing neuromechanics and energetics of the biological plantarﬂexors. Results: Stiffer ankle exoskeleton springs resulted in larger de- creases in plantarﬂexor muscle forces, activations, and metabolic energyconsumption.However,intheprocessofunloadingthecom- pliant biological muscle–tendon unit, the muscle fascicles expe- rienced larger excursions that negatively impacted series elastic element recoil that is characteristic of a tuned “catapult mecha- nism.” Conclusion: The combination of disrupted muscle–tendon dynamics and the need to produce compensatory forces\/moments to maintain overall net ankle moment invariance could explain the “sweet spot” in metabolic performance at intermediate ankle exoskeleton stiffness.

It senses and monitors the delivered force and power of the exoskeleton for motion control and taking urgent safety action. Two FSR (force-sensitive resistors) sensors are used to measure the assistance force when the user is walking. The sensor system directly measures the interaction force between the exoskeleton and the lower limb of the user instead of a previously reported force-sensing method, which estimated the hip assistance force from the current of the motor and lookup tables. Furthermore, the sensor system has the advantage of generating torque in the walking-assistant actuator based on directly measuring the hip-assistance force. Thus, the gait-assistance exoskeleton system can control the delivered power and torque to the user. The force sensing structure is designed to decouple the force caused by hip motion from other directional forces to the sensor so as to only measure that force. We conﬁrmed that the hip-assistance force could be measured with the proposed prototype compact force sensor attached to a thigh frame through an experiment with a real system.

These estimates could be used as a continuous reference signal for exoskeleton control, able to modulate exoskeleton assistance in real-world environments. In this study, sagittal plane biological hip torque during level ground, incline and decline walking was calculated using inverse dynamics of human subject data. Subsequently, this torque was estimated using neural network (NN) and XGBoost ML models. Model inputs consisted solely of mechanical sensor data onboard a robotic hip exoskeleton. These results were compared to a baseline method of estimating hip torque as the mean torque profile during ambulation. On average across conditions, the NN and XGBoost models estimated biological hip torque with an RMSE of 0.116±0.015 and 0.108±0.011 Nm\/kg, respectively, which was significantly less than the baseline estimation that had an RMSE of 0.300±0.145 Nm\/kg (p<0.05). Fitting the baseline method to ambulation mode specific data significantly reduced overall RMSE by 59.3%; however, the ML models were still significantly better than the baseline method (p<0.05). These results show that machine learning algorithms can estimate biological hip torque using only mechanical sensors onboard a hip exoskeleton better than simply using an average torque profile. This suggests that these estimation models could be suitable for modulating exoskeleton assistance. Additionally, no evidence suggested the need to train separate ML models for each ambulation mode as estimation RMSE was not significantly different across unified and separated ML models.  assistance modulation.

Hicks, Scott L. Delp, Steven H. Collins, IEEE Member  Abstract—While exoskeletons have markedly reduced the metabolic cost of walking, exoskeleton design remains expensive and time-consuming. Biomechanical simulations could improve exoskeleton development with their ability to optimize many design and control parameters simultaneously. While promis- ing, simulations often rely on simplifying assumptions, such as ﬁxed kinematic methods. Furthermore, few simulation-based designs have been tested directly in human experiments. To evaluate the utility of simulations for exoskeleton design, we designed a controller using biomechanical simulation and then tested the controller with a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton worn by a single experienced user. Here we show that a biomechanical simulation constrained by safe, experiment-based torque limits can ﬁnd an assistance pattern that reduces metabolic cost but with substantial differences between expected and measured outcomes. We found a simulated assistance proﬁle that was expected to reduce the metabolic cost of walking by 69.0%. When tested experimentally, it reduced the cost by 25.9% compared to walking in the device unassisted. The simulation predicted the direction of activity change in most muscles but overestimated the total magnitude of these changes. The applied torques resulted in joint kinematic and stride frequency changes that were not accounted for in the simulation. Future simulations could allow kinematic adaptations and use updated cost functions that better reﬂect how humans respond to assistance. Continued feedback between experimental testing and simulation design will build on these promising results to improve the accuracy of simulations and enhance their ability to guide future exoskeleton designs.  I. INTRODUCTION  Instead of relying on biomimicry, intuition, and hand-tuning, this technique uses measurements of the exoskeleton user to update the control of the exoskeleton to minimize a cost function.

The off-board system consists an actuation unit with two degrees of freedom that can transmit forces to our soft exosuit via Bowden cables. To perform accurate force tracking and cable slack management, we implemented a switching admittance-position control approach that utilizes the advantages of both admittance and position control. In particular, feedforward models (FFMs) are added to the admittance control to compensate variability of individual kinematics, nonlinear hip exosuit stiffness and actuator transmission loss to enable a more accurate force tracking. This system allows us to track force profiles accurately and robustly under normal walking or jogging speed. The performance of force tracking was evaluated on three subjects walking on a treadmill at 1.25 m\/s with various magnitude, shape, and timings of assistive profiles and jogging on a treadmill at 2.3 m\/s with varied magnitude of a representative assistance profile. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across different profiles. In case of walking experiments, the errors of the magnitude, RMS-E, and timing were within 2.0 N, 8.4 N, and 1.8% when varying the magnitude, shape, and timing respectively. In case of jogging experiments, the RMS-E was within 3.0 N.

INTRODUCTION In the past decades, lower-limb exoskeletons have been drawing intense research interest because of their potential applications to assist or augment human performances for various purposes. Some of the exoskeletons are designed to support and train a paraplegic’s body [1]–[7], while others improve the walking efficiency of able-bodied individuals, especially in case of load-carrying [8]–[11]. The majority of these devices consist of rigid structures, which are favorable for supporting the carried load or body weight and producing high assistive force to the wearer. However, the rigid nature can interfere natural movement of the wearer when the exoskeleton joints are misaligned with biological joints or the degree of freedom are not supported [12]–[14]. Moreover, the large inertia of rigid structures on the distal locations can significantly increase the wearer’s net metabolic rate when they are not fully compensated [8]","id":"fdcad11e-742e-4a55-80e0-fe8aa5773705"}

To evaluate the system, three studies were performed. The method was ﬁrst tested on 10 healthy young volunteer subjects in a gait laboratory where an ultrasonic motion system was used as a reference system. In the second study, the system was tested onthree hospitalized elderlypeopleto classifywalking upstairs fromwalkingdownstairs andﬂat walking.Inthe third study, monitoring was performed on seven patients with peripheral vascular disease for 60 min during their daily physical activity. The ﬁrst study revealed a close relationship between the ambulatory andthe reference systems.Compared to the reference system, the ambulatory system hadan overall sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 98% and 97%, respectively. In the second study, the ambulatory system also showed a very high sensitivity (>94%) in identifying a 50 stairs ascent from walking on the ﬂat and walking downstairs. Finally, compared with visual surveillance, we observed a relatively high accuracy in identifying 196 walking upstairs cycles through daily physical activity in the third study.

The wearable device, to be worn invisibly underneath clothes, not only ﬁts tightly to the wearer’s lower body, but also comfortably transmits assistive torque to the wearer’s hip\/knee joint. To overcome deﬁciencies in the usability of conventional wearable walking assistance devices, two novel features are proposed: 1) a unique ﬂexible support frame that withstands vertical loads while maintaining the natural curvature of the wearer’s lower body; and 2) a kinematically similar anthropomorphic joint that minimizes the unintended resistance force during the wearer’s usual motions. The developed wearable walking assistance de- vice based on these features was veriﬁed by simulations and experiments whose results are described.

Our previous study presented a lightweight prosthesis with damping behav- iors, which can adapt to different terrains. However, the proposed prosthesis cannot provide push-off during the stance phase. In this paper, we redesigned the mechanical structure, combining push-off and damping behaviors. The Peking University Robotic Trantibial Prosthesis (PKU- RoboTPro-) II makes a trade-off between push-off power and lightweight. Three unilateral transtibial subjects partic- ipated in the study. Gait symmetry and metabolic cost of walking with the proposed prosthesis were evaluated under conditions of three terrains and four walking speeds. The gait symmetry of the subjects using the prosthesis com- bining push-off and damping behaviors in stance time and ground reaction force distribution are improved. Meanwhile, the PKU-RoboTPro-II with a push-off mode can reduce en- ergy expenditure, with an average 14% ± 8% reduction and a maximal 31% reduction under different conditions, com- pared with a non-push-off mode. When the weight of the lithium-ion rechargeable battery is 0.28 kg (2.6 Ah), it en- ables the new prosthesis combining push-off and damping behaviors to walk approximately 10 000 strides, on average.

ABSTRACT  Three individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) were tested in a laboratory setting while wearing a mobility-assisting device called a dermoskeleton. The tested device used was the B-TEMIA’s military-based version dedicated to military applications, with the necessary design adjustments for the proposed study. Participants performed standardized tasks (Time Up and Go, Stair Test, 6 Minute Walk Test) with and without the dermoskeleton, and execution times were compared. Pilot data show improvement of gait with the device in 2 of the 3 participants, in terms of stability (higher inter-step hip kinematics coherence) and endurance (longer the 6 Minute Walk Test). The distance during dermoskeleton was moderately to highly valued by participants during the laboratory tests. While the results from this pilot study suggest a potential for dermoskeletal technology in improving mobility in persons with MS, additional tests in a community setting are now required to quantify the efficacy and safety of the innovation as well as how the tested device can be used in daily activities, and more broadly improve the quality of life of its users.  a pilot study if such technology could also be useful as a means to improve endurance in persons with muscle weakness due to central nervous system lesions.","id":"9268234d-f8b3-479e-b6d0-0283a14bf1ce"}

The orthotic compo- nents consist of electromechanical joints that lock and unlock automatically to provide upright stability and free movement powered by FES. Preliminary results from a prototype device on nondisabled and SCI volunteers are presented. A novel vari- able coupling hip-reciprocating mechanism either acts as a standard reciprocating gait orthosis or allows each hip to inde- pendently lock or rotate freely. Rotary actuators at each hip are configured in a closed hydraulic circuit and regulated by a finite state postural controller based on real-time sensor infor- mation. The knee mechanism locks during stance to prevent collapse and unlocks during swing, while the ankle is con- strained to move in the sagittal plane under FES-only control. The trunk is fixed in a rigid corset, and new ankle and trunk mechanisms are under development. Because the exoskeletal control mechanisms were built from off-the-shelf components, weight and cosmesis specifications for clinical use have not been met, although the power requirements are low enough to provide more than 4 hours of continuous operation with standard camcorder batteries.

Compared with the muscle, the ankle joint produced relatively similar moments across the walking tasks and participants. Changes in ankle power were more similar to the estimated muscle response across walking speeds (Fig. 3A, figs. S2 and S3, table S2). This is likely reflective of increased angular velocity and may suggest that the force generated during concentric contraction of the muscle is primarily directed at increasing joint velocity when modulating walking speed. However, ankle power did not follow the same trend as the muscle for incline walking. The largest disparity between the joint (+13% increase in peak ankle moment and +19% in peak ankle power compared with level) and the estimated muscle force (+92%) happens in incline walking. This is expected as the muscle must produce more work to add energy to the center of mass to overcome gravity, rather than relying upon passive energy storage and return. These data suggest that there may be different neuromuscular strategies that individuals develop depending on tasks and on variability in physiologic features such as tendon stiffness (68, 69), that in the end result in more similar response to the external environment at the joint level.  Our data found no correlation between peak MBA exosuit torque (non-mass normalized) and body mass in contrast to the established positive correlation between peak ankle moment (non- mass normalized) and body mass (70). Because of this relationship between ankle moment and body mass, assistance profiles are often scaled to the participant body mass (15, 20, 37, 40, 50). However, our data suggest that individual underlying physiology can be complicated and nonintuitive, and that assistance strategies should consider the underlying physiology and task- specific demands at the muscle level.","id":"ecea4ff8-879a-426d-9bb4-f441f9e5fc53"}

Gregg  Abstract—In this work, we introduce a novel approach to assistive exoskeleton (or powered orthosis) control which avoids needing task and gait phase information. Our approach is based on directly designing the Hamiltonian dynamics of the target closed-loop behavior, shaping the energy of the human and the robot. Relative to previous energy shaping controllers for assistive exoskeletons, we introduce ground reaction force and torque information into the target behavior deﬁnition, reformulate the kinematics so as to avoid explicit matching conditions due to under-actuation, and avoid the need to switch between swing and stance energy shapes. Our controller introduces new states into the target Hamiltonian energy that represent a virtual second leg that is connected to the physical leg using virtual springs. The impulse the human imparts to the physical leg is ampliﬁed and applied to the virtual leg, but the ground reaction force acts only on the physical leg. A state transformation allows the proposed control to be available using only encoders, an IMU, and ground reaction force sensors. We prove that this controller is stable and passive when acted on by the ground reaction force and demonstrate the controller’s strength amplifying behavior in a simulation. A linear analysis based on small signal assumptions allows us to explain the relationship between our tuning parameters and the frequency domain ampliﬁcation bandwidth.  I. INTRODUCTION  Recent advances in exoskeleton technology have resulted in a class of light-weight assistive lower-body exoskeletons that can reduce the muscle effort [1] or metabolic cost of locomotion [2]–[5]. These systems are a departure from the better known humanoid-like lower-body exoskeletons (e.g. HAL [6], ATLANTE [7], ReWalk [8], or Mina v2 [9]) in that they are designed not to impose kinematics but rather to be back-driven by the users, providing assistive torque to augment a human that remains in direct control of the limb kinematics. But a lack of control strategies that allow these devices to transition between the various tasks (such as walking at different speeds, over ramps, up stairs, etc.) is one of the key factors keeping them from practical application [10]. These transitions are critical for assisting people in activities of daily living (ADLs) which feature short bouts of walking on the order of 30 seconds [11].","id":"6c69aa59-8696-49af-9451-9e7d77427328"}

Kuo, J. Maxwell Donelan  A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deﬁcits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deﬁcits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies.

Index Terms—Permanent-magnet  synchronous machines,  modeling techniques.  I. INTRODUCTION  A SURFACE-MOUNTED permanent-magnet machine has  two distinct regions. One is the rotor and air gap, and the other is the stator. The rotor and gap are uniform in their construction, and one can solve Maxwell’s Equations to derive an essentially exact analysis of their magnetic behaviors. The stator is much more intricate with teeth, slots, and wedges that stick into the slots from the teeth at the air gap. The stator also tends to saturate, whereas the rotor does not. It is not feasible to analyze the stator by analytically solving Maxwell’s Equations due to both geometric complexity and nonlinearity.  Fig. 1. Explanation of Approach.  One approach to analyzing the machine is Finite Element Analysis (FEA) which carries the expense of computation time. It requires a ﬁne mesh at least in the stator to capture its ge- ometrical intricacies. FEA is inappropriate for the rotor since the rotor can be effectively analyzed by an explicit solution of Maxell’s Equations. One could also analyze the stator using a nonlinear ﬂux tube analysis. This is an approximation, but not a bad one if attention is paid to geometric details.  Our approach is to analytically solve Maxwell’s Equations for each space harmonic in the rotor and airgap and to use a ﬂux tube analysis for the stator. Each analysis is appropriate for its own region, and quite fast compared to FEA.

The exosuit combines textile garments with cable driven actuators and is lighter and more compliant as compared to traditional rigid exoskeletons. By avoiding the use of rigid elements, exosuits offer greater comfort, facilitate donning\/doffing, and do not impose kinematic restrictions on the wearer – all while retaining the ability to generate significant moments at target joints during walking. The stroke-specific exosuit adapted from previous exosuit designs provides unilateral assistance to the paretic limb during walking. This paper describes stroke- specific design considerations, the design of the textile components, the development of a research-focused, mobile off-board actuation unit capable of testing the exosuit in a variety of walking conditions, a real-time gait detection and control algorithm, and proof-of-principle data validating the use of the exosuit in the chronic stroke population. Ultimately, we demonstrate reliable tracking of poststroke gait, appropriate timing of assistive forces, and improvements in key gait metrics. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of exosuits for poststroke gait assistance and training.

IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS  Design and Control of a Novel Active Shoulder Exoskeleton for Overhead Work Assistance  Shuo Ding , Ashwin Narayan , Associate Member, IEEE, Francisco Anaya Reyes , Shuishuai Han , and Haoyong Yu , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—This article presents a novel active shoulder exoskeleton to assist overhead work. The exoskeleton has its actuators, control electronics, and the battery packed in a drive unit located on the user’s back. Bowden cables are used to transmit the forces from the drive unit to the shoulder joints of two lightweight arm support structures. Due to the ﬂexibility of the Bowden cable, the exoskeleton can adapt to complex shoulder joint movements. Linear series elastic actuators are used to achieve force control instead of position control for overhead work assistance. The design speciﬁcations achieve a portable and compliant system. In addition, a multimodal assistive strategy has been developed to handle different working conditions with seamless switching between different modes: free mode with zero torque tracking when no assistance is needed, assist mode during overhead work, and safe mode when a sudden impact load is detected. Experimental studies conducted in simulated overhead work conditions demon- strated the usability and effectiveness of the system. Sta- tistical analysis of the electromyography signals from the key shoulder muscles indicated that the exoskeleton could reduce the level of shoulder muscle activation by up to 40%.

Speciﬁcally, the accuracy and eﬃciency can be balanced well by BLS. However, the presence of outliers in data may destroy the stability and generality of standard BLS. In this paper, we propose the robust version of BL S (RBL S) to treat the data modeling with outliers. By assuming the regression residual and output weights follow their respective distributions, the objective function for RBLS is derived and the output weights for robust modeling can be determined by maximum a posterior estimation. Then the robustness of RBLS can be enhanced further by integrating the regularization theory. The Augmented Lagrange Multiplier method is utilized to optimize the novel models eﬃciently, and a solid theoretical proof is given to guarantee that the proposed RBLS is more robust than the standard BLS. Extensive ex- periments on function approximation and real-world regression are carried out to demonstrate that our proposed RBLS model can achieve a better modeling performance in uncertain data environment than the standard BLS and other regression algorithms.  © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When defining requirements for any wearable robot for walking assistance, it is important to maximize the user’s metabolic benefit resulting from the exosuit assistance while limiting the metabolic penalty of carrying the system’s mass. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the relationship between assistance magnitude and the metabolic cost of walking while also examining changes to the wearer’s underlying gait mechanics. The study was performed with a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit during normal walking, where assistance was di- rectly applied at the ankle joint and indirectly at the hip due to a textile architecture. The exosuit controller was designed such that the delivered torque profile at the ankle joint approximated that of the biological torque during normal walking. Seven participants walked on a treadmill at 1.5 meters per second under one unpowered and four powered conditions, where the peak moment applied at the ankle joint was varied from about 10 to 38% of biological ankle moment (equivalent to an applied force of 18.7 to 75.0% of body weight). Results showed that, with increasing exosuit assistance, net metabolic rate continually decreased within the tested range. When maximum assistance was applied, the metabolic rate of walking was reduced by 22.83 ± 3.17% relative to the powered-off condition (mean ± SEM).","id":"73d129c7-ad0b-4999-9632-4c172fecff6e"}

Although some studies have studied the effects of using rehabilitation exoskeletons for patients rehabilitation, the improvement of patient gait quality with a single knee exoskeleton has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, a deep neural network-based biological torque controller is presented for real-time control of the unilateral knee exoskeleton. The aim was to improve the gait quality of patients by enhancing their gait symmetry. A lightweight unilateral knee exoskeleton system with low passive impedance and well transparent was used to develop and validate the controller during both treadmill and level walking modes. The proposed control strategy is characterized by accurate assisted output torque even when the motion pattern is changed, and does not require controller parameter adjustment. To test it, five able-bodied subjects used an exoskeleton with an artificial blocking device at the knee joint position that simulated the patient ’ s defective postoperative pathological gait( i.e., reduced knee flexion). The subjects walked continuously on a treadmill and a flat surface. The experimental results demonstrated that the control strategy effectively improved the gait quality of the participants.

Young , Member, IEEE  Abstract—Ankle exoskeletons have the potential to improve mo- bility, but common controllers are often inﬂexible to variations in tasks, such as changes in walking speed. To enable effective variable-speed exoboot control, we developed and validated a two- headed convolutional neural network trained to (1) classify stance versus swing and (2) predict the phase during stance, which was then mapped to a desired exoboot torque. This Machine Learning Estimator (MLE) was trained from nine participants walking at three speeds and four exoboot assistancelevels. A Time-BasedEsti- mator (TBE)that predicted gait phase from the two previous stride durations was used to apply realistic torques during MLE training and served as a within–participant control condition. The MLE wasvalidatedonlinewiththreenewparticipantswalkingatarange of speeds and torques, both interpolating within and extrapolating outside the training set. Online validation accuracy (RMSE) across tested speeds and torque levels was 3.9%. On a simple walking task in which treadmill speed was varied sinusoidally between 1.1 and 1.6 m\/s with a 30 s period, the three participants exhibited a mean 5.2% decrease in metabolic expenditure with the MLE compared to no-exo (boots only), but exhibited a 5.4% increase when walking with the TBE.

Without expert guidance, people can even increase the risk of injury by choosing a comfortable posture rather than the appropriate one, notably when lifting objects. Even in situations where squatting is accepted as a desirable lifting strategy, people tend to choose the more comfortable strategy of stooping or semisquatting. The common approach to correcting lifting posture, immobilizing vulnerable joints via fixation, is insufficient for preventing back injuries sustained from repetitive lifting. Instead, when lifting small but heavy objects, the entire kinetic chain should cooperate to achieve a series of squat-lifting patterns. Inspired by the observation that force fields affect the coordination of voluntary human motion, we devised a passive exosuit embedded with a body-powered variable-impedance mechanism. The exosuit adds impedance to the human joints according to how far the wearer’s movement is from the squat-lifting trajectories so that it hinders stooping but facilitates squatting. In an experiment that entailed lifting a small 10-kg box, 10 first-time users changed their voluntary lifting motion closer to squatting on average. Simulation results based on recorded kinematic and kinetic data showed that this postural change reduced the compression force, shear force, and moment on the lumbosacral joint. Our work demonstrates the potential of using an exosuit to help people move in a desirable manner without requiring a complicated, bulky mechanical system.","id":"e077098a-f86a-423a-bb66-1020da1648cc"}

Shepherd, Student Member, IEEE, and Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE  Abstract—Individuals with poststroke hemiparesis often exhibit mobility deﬁcits, particularly during tasks requiring high lower limb torques. The sit-to-stand transition is con- sistently marked by asymmetrical weight-bearing between the paretic and unaffected legs. One way to improve char- acteristics of stroke sit-to-stand may be to provide assis- tive knee extension torque with a powered exoskeleton. To perform research on the biomechanical effects of as- sisting sit-to-stand, a unilateral powered knee exoskeleton is required, which can accurately control torque. This pa- per introduces a novel series elastic actuator capable of producing the full torques and speeds required for sit-to- stand (80 Nm, 3 rad\/s). It utilizes a unique transmission conﬁguration with a series ﬁberglass beam spring that im- proves torque-control and reduces output impedance. The actuator is incorporated into a unilateral orthosis and a high-level sit-to-stand controller is implemented. A small validation study with three able-bodied subjects perform- ing sit-to-stand is presented, demonstrating the ability to appropriately provide assistance.  of the torque required for more normative sit-to-stand [5]. The knee may provide up to 70% of the mechanical work to com- plete the transition [6], so this deﬁcit leaves other joints or excessive pre-seat-off torso momentum to compensate. Knee strength is also a strong predictor of the ability to per- form independent sit-to-stand in more severely affected patients [7].  A knee exoskeleton providing extension assistance during sit-to-stand may be able to compensate for the missing knee torque and improve weight-bearing symmetry. To explore this concept, we plan to perform research with stroke subjects where assistivetorqueisprovidedbyakneeexoskeleton.

Based on Angular and torque curves of each joint of the lower limb, the motion of each joint was analyzed and compared during walking up and down stairs and on the flat ground, so as to arrive at the reason why the elderly people struggle to walk up and down stairs, and according to this, the design requirements and overall scheme of the exoskeleton were provided. According to the overall scheme, the exoskeleton was divided into knee component, ankle component and backpack component, and the detailed structural design of the three components was carried out. The hardware and software system of the exoskeleton was designed to complete the acquisition of sensor data and the motion control of the exoskeleton, and to pre-process the gait data for gait recognition.

Walsh1,2  , Denise Martineli Rossi1,2,4, Christopher Siviy1,2, Sangjun Lee1,2,  Abstract  Background: Different groups developed wearable robots for walking assistance, but there is still a need for methods to quickly tune actuation parameters for each robot and population or sometimes even for individual users. Protocols where parameters are held constant for multiple minutes have traditionally been used for evaluating responses to parameter changes such as metabolic rate or walking symmetry. However, these discrete protocols are time-consuming. Recently, protocols have been proposed where a parameter is changed in a continuous way. The aim of the present study was to compare effects of continuously varying assistance magnitude with a soft exosuit against discrete step conditions.  Methods: Seven participants walked on a treadmill wearing a soft exosuit that assists plantarflexion and hip flexion. In Continuous-up, peak exosuit ankle moment linearly increased from approximately 0 to 38% of biological moment over 10 min. Continuous-down was the opposite. In Discrete, participants underwent five periods of 5 min with steady peak moment levels distributed over the same range as Continuous-up and Continuous-down. We calculated metabolic rate for the entire Continuous-up and Continuous-down conditions and the last 2 min of each Discrete force level. We compared kinematics, kinetics and metabolic rate between conditions by curve fitting versus peak moment. Results: Reduction in metabolic rate compared to Powered-off was smaller in Continuous-up than in Continuous- down at most peak moment levels, due to physiological dynamics causing metabolic measurements in Continuous- up and Continuous-down to lag behind the values expected during steady-state testing. When evaluating the average slope of metabolic reduction over the entire peak moment range there was no significant difference between Continuous-down and Discrete. Attempting to correct the lag in metabolics by taking the average of Continuous-up and Continuous-down removed all significant differences versus Discrete. For kinematic and kinetic parameters, there were no differences between all conditions.","id":"d9723c08-0ef0-4b1c-970a-35a437606e1a"}

Lawson, Student Member, IEEE, Brian Ruhe, Amanda Shultz, Student Member, IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb∗, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper presents the design and validation of a control system for a pair of powered knee and ankle prostheses to be used as a prosthetic intervention for bilateral transfemoral amputees. The control system leverages communication between the prostheses for enhanced awareness and stability, along with power generation at the knee and ankle joints to better restore biomechanical functionality in level ground walking. The control methodology employed is a combination of an impedance-based framework for weight-bearing portions of gait and a trajectory- based approach for the nonweight-bearing portions. The control system was implemented on a pair of self-contained powered knee and ankle prostheses, and the ability of the prostheses and control approach to provide walking functionality was assessed in a set of experimental trials with a bilateral transfemoral amputee subject. Speciﬁcally, experimental data from these trials indicate that the powered prostheses and bilateral control architecture provide gait kinematics that reproduce healthy gait kinematics to a greater extent than the subject’s daily-use passive prostheses.

In the largest amputee demographicstudyknowntotheauthors,personssufferingmul- tiple amputations were not distinguished, although the total number of amputees was shown to be both large (with over 600 000 being either above the knee, below the knee, or the foot) and rapidly growing (projected to double over the next 50 years) [1]. The absence of an explicit report of the number of bilateral transfemoral amputees in the preceding study suggests that the population may be relatively small compared to the total number of persons living with a lower limb amputation.","id":"caba292d-3f12-4d0a-929b-fffff5015927"}

Gregg  Abstract—This paper describes the design of a powered knee- and-ankle transfemoral prosthetic leg, which implements high torque density actuators with low-reduction transmissions. The low reduction of the transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible beneﬁts over modern actuation styles implemented in emerging robotic prosthetic legs. Such beneﬁts include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, and greater potential for power regeneration. Benchtop validation experiments were conducted to verify some of these beneﬁts. Backdrive and free- swinging knee tests conﬁrm that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (˜3 Nm). Bandwidth tests reveal that the actuator is capable of achieving frequencies required for walk- ing and running. Lastly, open-loop impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufﬁciently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback.  into the user’s gait. By actively injecting energy into the user’s gait, powered prostheses have the capability to restore mobility and quality of life to those who live with the loss of a limb.  In the last decade, a great amount of research has gone into the design and control of powered prosthetic limbs [6], [7]. Many powered prosthetic devices have emerged from this research, several of which implement non-backdrivable actuators, consisting of high-speed, low-torque motors with high-ratio transmissions, such as ball screws or multiple gear stages [4], [6], [8]–[16]. In the past few years, legged robots such as the quadruped MIT Cheetah [17], biped ATRIAS [18], and others [19] have embraced high-torque motors with low-ratio or no transmissions. Inspired by this approach, ex- oskeletons in the ﬁeld of rehabilitation robotics have recently implemented high-torque motors in combination with low- ratio transmissions, such as the University of Texas at Dallas powered knee-ankle orthosis [20].

Stair Ascent Phase-Variable Control of a Powered Knee-Ankle Prosthesis  Ross J. Cortino,  Edgar Bolívar-Nieto,  T. Kevin Best,  Robert D. Gregg  Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Robotics Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.  Abstract  Passive prostheses cannot provide the net positive work required at the knee and ankle for step- over stair ascent. Powered prostheses can provide this net positive work, but user synchronization of joint motion and power input are critical to enabling natural stair ascent gaits. In this work, we build on previous phase variable-based control methods for walking and propose a stair ascent controller driven by the motion of the user’s residual thigh. We use reference kinematics from an able-bodied dataset to produce knee and ankle joint trajectories parameterized by gait phase. We redefine the gait cycle to begin at the point of maximum hip flexion instead of heel strike to improve the phase estimate. Able-bodied bypass adapter experiments demonstrate that the phase variable controller replicates normative able-bodied kinematic trajectories with a root mean squared error of 12.66° and 2.64° for the knee and ankle, respectively. The knee and ankle joints provided on average 0.39 J\/kg and 0.21 J\/kg per stride, compared to the normative averages of 0.34 J\/kg and 0.21 J\/kg, respectively. Thus, this controller allows powered knee-ankle prostheses to perform net positive mechanical work to assist stair ascent.  I.  Introduction","id":"0517a12c-3f9d-4182-bbcb-ba68cbaf6001"}

Collins∗  Abstract—Ankle inversion-eversion compliance is an important feature of conventional prosthetic feet, and control of inversion, or roll, in active prostheses could improve balance for people with amputation. We designed a tethered ankle-foot prosthesis with two independently-actuated toes that are coordinated to provide plantarﬂexion and inversion-eversion torques. A Bowden cable tether provides series elasticity. The prosthesis is simple and lightweight, with a mass of 0.72 kg. Strain gauges on the toes measure torque with less than 1% RMS error. Benchtop tests demonstrated a rise time of less than 33 ms, peak torques of 250 N·m in plantarﬂexion and ±30 N·m in inversion-eversion, and peak power above 3 kW. The phase-limited closed-loop torque bandwidth is 20 Hz with a chirp from 10 to 90 N·m in plantarﬂexion, and 24 Hz with a chirp from −20 to 20 N·m in inversion. The system has low sensitivity to toe position disturbances at frequencies of up to 18 Hz. Walking trials with an amputee subject demonstrated RMS torque tracking errors of less than 5.1 N·m in plantarﬂexion and less than 1.5 N·m in inversion-eversion. These properties make the platform suitable for testing inversion-related prosthesis features and controllers in experiments with humans.

To assess the biomechanical evidence in support of advocating the squat lifting technique as an administrative control  to prevent low back pain.  Background. Instruction with respect to lifting technique is commonly employed to prevent low back pain. The squat technique is the most widely advised lifting technique. Intervention studies failed to show health eects of this approach and consequently the rationale behind the advised lifting techniques has been questioned.  Methods. Biomechanical studies comparing the stoop and squat technique were systematically reviewed. The dependent variables used in these studies and the methods by which these were measured or estimated were ranked for validity as indicators of low back load.  Results. Spinal compression as indicated by intra-discal pressure and spinal shrinkage appeared not signiﬁcantly dierent be- tween both lifting techniques. Net moments and compression forces based on model estimates were found to be equal or somewhat higher in squat than in stoop lifting. Only when the load could be lifted from a position in between the feet did squat lifting cause lower net moments, although the studies reporting this ﬁnding had a marginal validity. Shear force and bending moments acting on the spine appeared lower in squat lifting. Net moments and compression forces during lifting reach magnitudes, that can probably cause injury, whereas shear forces and bending moments remained below injury threshold in both techniques.  Conclusion. The biomechanical literature does not provide support for advocating the squat technique as a means of preventing  low back pain.  Relevance  Training in lifting technique is widely used in primary and secondary prevention of low back pain, though health eects have not been proven. The present review assesses the biomechanical evidence supporting the most widely advocated lifting tech- nique.  1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The prosthesis and controller enable users to perform both step-over and step-to stair ascent and descent. The efficacy of the controller and SCSA prosthesis prototype in providing improved stair ambulation was tested on a unilateral transfemoral amputee in experiments that employed motion capture apparatus to compare joint kinematics with the SCSA prosthesis, relative to performing the same activity with a microprocessor-controlled daily-use passive prosthesis. Results suggest that the SCSA knee significantly decreases compensatory motion during stair activity when compared to the passive prosthesis. I. INTRODUCTION Many tasks of daily living are often more difficult for persons with transfemoral amputation than for their age-matched non-amputee counterparts [1, 2]. One task frequently performed either in the home or in daily life which has been shown to be exceptionally difficult for persons with amputation is traversing stairs [3]. Perhaps the most common type of knee prosthesis which provides stair ambulation capability is a microprocessor-controlled knee (MPK). MPKs incorporate stance control via modulated dampers that dissipate energy and thus provide controlled stance-knee yielding during stair descent. Such devices are capable of providing good step-to or step-over stair descent functionality. Although MPKs can provide adequate stair descent functionality, they are more limited in their ability to provide stair ascent functionality, due to two essential limitations: lack of active knee extension during stance phase, and lack of swing control during swing phase. The first assists during the stance phase of stair ascent in which the body center-of-mass is lifted, while the second guides the swing foot over the subsequent stair riser and onto the tread during the swing phase. The first of these limitations is less fundamental than the second. Specifically, in stance phase, an amputee can provide stance knee extension via hip extension. In swing phase, however, an amputee cannot directly provide a desired knee motion via hip effort. Specifically, a passive transfemoral prosthesis (e.g., an MPK) can be thought of as a double link pendulum with an actuated revolute joint at the hip and unactuated revolute joint at the knee. As shown in Fig.1, when in stance phase, the foot of the prosthesis is grounded, and as such the leg is fully controllable by the hip (i.e","id":"b5faa9e5-161c-43c7-923c-8ffbdb0cfa57"}

In the same order, the lowest median frequency (MF) existed 1, 1 and 2 times. Muscle fatigue was 4 times in squat, 36 in semi-squat and 43 in stoop lifting. Heart rate was the highest in squat and lowest in stoop respectively, with a middle level in semi-squat lifting. It may be recommended to adopt mainly the semi-squat technique for daily lifting works. For heavy lifting, it should use the squat technique.

A human augmentation approach based on the application of bio- mechatronics and artificial intelligence, and referred to as the “Dermoskeleton” concept or Knee Stress Release Device (KSRD™), aims to address the distributed weight overload challenge. This device attaches to the outer sections of both legs and provides assistance during walking. This report describes a user evaluation of the KSRD™ beta version using regular force members of the Canadian Forces. Results suggest that the KSRD™ beta version performance improves as more load is added onto the soldier. The addition of the KSRD™ beta version produced similar physiological effects as adding weight to the participants’ total load. Several recommendations are provided with respect to future studies involving future versions of the KSRD™.  INTRODUCTION The typical weight burden of dismounted soldiers  often exceeds 40 kg, i.e. more than 50% of the body weight, which is much beyond the recommended human factor safe load limits (Bedard, Tack, Pageau, Ricard, and Rittenhouse, 2011). This produces a significant strain on the musculoskeletal system in order to transport these loads over long distances. During a three year period from January 2004 to December 2007, of all the medical evacuations from both Iraq and Afghanistan, 31% were due to musculoskeletal, connective tissue, or spinal cord injuries, which excessive weight carried by soldiers is a contributing factor. Of these injuries, more than 80% of the soldiers never returned to combat (Bernton, 2011).","id":"3920859c-d009-4edc-8c8b-8d67f110d4b0"}

Gregg2,3  Abstract—This paper presents the mechatronic design and initial validation of a partial-assist knee orthosis for individuals with musculoskeletal disorders, e.g., knee osteoarthritis and lower back pain. This orthosis utilizes a quasi-direct drive ac- tuator with a low-ratio transmission (7:1) to greatly reduce the reﬂected inertia for high backdrivability. To provide meaningful assistance, a custom Brushless DC (BLDC) motor is designed with encapsulated windings to improve the motor’s thermal environment and thus its continuous torque output. The 2.69 kg orthosis is constructed from all custom-made components with a high package factor for lighter weight and a more compact size. The combination of compactness, backdrivability, and torque output enables the orthosis to provide partial assistance without obstructing the natural movement of the user. Several benchtop tests verify the actuator’s capabilities, and a human subject experiment demonstrates reduced quadriceps muscle activation when assisted during a repetitive lifting and lowering task.  I. INTRODUCTION  Traditionally, exoskeletons (i.e., powered orthoses) aid paraplegic individuals with little to no remnant voluntary movement, e.g., following a severe stroke or spinal cord injury [1], [2]. As a result, many exoskeleton designs have focused on achieving high torque output to fully support the lower extremities. However, larger populations of individuals with musculoskeletal disorders would beneﬁt from partial assistance of their musculature rather than full assistance. This includes 27 million individuals with osteoarthritis [3] and 66 million individuals with lower back pain [4] in the USA alone. Weak quadriceps musculature is a signiﬁcant contributing factor to the persistence and progression of both conditions, a limitation that can potentially be resolved by assistive knee torques. In the case of knee osteoarthritis, the this assistance would in turn reduce high forces at patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints, ultimately reducing pain [5], [6]. Likewise, lower back pain that results from repetitive lifting and lowering (L&L) tasks could poten- tially beneﬁt from partial assistance, as fatigued quadriceps contribute to poor posture in these tasks [7]. To achieve partial assistance, several design goals must be balanced: 1) facilitation of non-hindered voluntary movement of the user","id":"854a29f0-1c94-4e56-baae-6e620cc5b991"}

The Relationship Between Joint Strength and Standing Vertical Jump Performance  Kuangyou B. Cheng National Cheng Kung University  The effect of joint strengthening on standing vertical jump height is investigated by computer simulation. The human model consists of five rigid segments representing the feet, shanks, thighs, HT (head and trunk), and arms. Segments are connected by frictionless revolute joints and model movement is driven by joint torque actuators. Each joint torque is the product of maximum isometric torque and three variable functions of instantaneous joint angle, angular velocity, and activation level, respectively. Jumping movements starting from a balanced ini- tial posture and ending at takeoff are simulated. A matching simulation reproducing the actual jumping movement is generated by optimizing joint activation level. Simulations with the goal of maximizing jump height are repeated for varying maximum isometric torque of one joint by up to ±20% while keeping other joint strength values unchanged. Similar to previous studies, reoptimization of activation after joint strengthening is necessary for increasing jump height. The knee and ankle are the most effective joints in changing jump height (by as much as 2.4%, or 3 cm). For the same amount of percentage increase\/ decrease in strength, the shoulder is the least effective joint (which changes height by as much as 0.6%), but its influence should not be overlooked.

I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external. Specifically, a number of researchers have investigated the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) to artificially control leg muscle contraction, thereby utilizing the metabolic power supply of the paraplegic subject to facilitate legged locomotion. Some of the research efforts in this regard include [1-3]. Note that, in addition to providing power for locomotion, FES-aided gait has also been shown to provide a number of associated physiological benefits, some of which include increased muscle strength, increased bone density, decreased spasticity, and improved cardiovascular health [4-6]. Despite this, FES-based systems entail a number of challenges; most notably, (1) in the absence of adequate sensory information muscles are difficult to control, and (2) the rapid muscle fatigue promote by the synchronous recruitment of muscle fibers occurred in FES. Rather than utilize the metabolic power source provided by stimulated muscle, other researchers have developed lower limb exoskeletons, which utilize external power (e.g., a battery pack) to provide a source of motive power to facilitate legged locomotion. Some of the efforts in this regard include [7-15]. This approach avoids the controllability and fatigue issues associated with FES, but such approaches do not offer the physiological benefits associated with FES, and also","id":"f6f50518-ce13-43dc-9b41-a684f99559ac"}

Martin and Robert D. Gregg  Abstract—Predictive simulations of human walking could be used to in- vestigate a wide range of questions. Promising moderately complex models have been developed using the robotics control technique called hybrid zero dynamics (HZD). Existing simulations of human walking only con- sider the mean motion; therefore, they cannot be used to investigate fall risk, which is correlated with variability. This study determines how to in- corporate human-like variability into an HZD-based healthy human model to generate a more realistic gait. The key challenge is determining how to combine the existing mathematical description of variability with the dy- namic model so that the biped is still able to walk without falling. To do so, the commanded motion is augmented with a sinusoidal variability function and a polynomial correction function. The variability function captures the variationinjointangles,whilethecorrectionfunctionpreventsthevariabil- ity function from growing uncontrollably. The necessity of the correction function and the improvements with a reduction of stance ankle variability are demonstrated via simulations. The variability in temporal measures is shown to be similar to experimental values.  Index Terms—Biomimetics, human locomotion, legged robots, motion  control, variability.  I. INTRODUCTION  T HE ability to model and predict human gait can be used  to answer scientiﬁc questions that are difﬁcult or impos- sible to answer with human subject studies. For example, in- vestigations of periodic gait have provided insights into muscle contributions [1]. Further, predictive simulations could allow for preliminary testing of assistive devices, such as validating controllers for a powered leg prosthesis prior to hardware im- plementation with human amputee subjects [2].  Despite the common assumption that human gait is periodic, signiﬁcant variability exists. This variability has long-range cor- relationsbetweensteps[3],[4]andstructureatthejointlevel[5]. The joint-level variability has been mathematically described, but no attempt to incorporate it into a dynamic model has been made [5].

Lerner  Abstract—Most people with cerebral palsy (CP) suffer from impaired walking ability and pathological gait pat- terns. Seeking to improve the effectiveness of gait train- ing in this patient population, this study developed and assessed the feasibility of a real-time biofeedback mech- anism to augment untethered ankle exoskeleton-assisted walking performance in individuals with CP. We selected step length as a clinically-relevant gait performance target and utilized a visual interface with live performance scores. An adaptive ankle exoskeleton control algorithm provided assistance proportional to the real-time ankle moment. We assessed lower-extremity gait mechanics and muscle activity in seven ambulatory individuals with CP as they walked with adaptive ankle assistance alone and with ankle assistance plus step-length biofeedback. We achieved our technical validation goal by demonstrating a strong corre- lation between estimated step length and real step length (R = 0.771, p < 0.001). We achieved our clinical feasibil- ity goal by demonstrating that biofeedback-plus-assistance resulted in a 14% increase in step length relative to baseline (p ≤ 0.05), while no difference in step length was observed for assistance alone. Additionally, we observed near imme- diate improvements in lower-extremity posture, moments, and positive power relative to baseline for biofeedback- plus-assistance (p < 0.05), with none, or more-limited improvements observed for assistance alone. Our ﬁndings suggestthatprovidingreal-timebiofeedbackandusingstep length as the target can be effective for increasing the rate at which individuals with CP improve their gait mechanics when walking with wearable ankle assistance.  I. INTRODUCTION  INDIVIDUALS with cerebral palsy (CP) experience move-  ment and posture impairment that negatively affects their mobility and physical activity levels [1], [2]. They often exhibit pathological gait patterns that can involve excessive knee and hip ﬂexion during stance and reduced ankle plantarﬂexion prior to push-off. These gait patterns are associated with slow walking speed, reduced step length and increased energy cost of transport [3]–[5]. Many children with CP experience a steady decline in mobility across their lifespan [6].","id":"a233c1c2-2627-44f8-a661-598c9ae35f8e"}

Characterizing Optimal Performance of a Passive Elastic Ankle Exoskeleton during Human Locomotion. (Under the direction of Gregory S. Sawicki).  Perhaps because humans are already so well-tuned for locomotion, no  autonomous, wearable device intended to assist walking or running has succeeded  in reducing metabolic energy consumption for healthy individuals during typical  walking conditions. The ankle provides the majority of positive mechanical work  during walking and much of this work is delivered via elastic recoil from the Achilles’  tendon, which may serve as an energy savings mechanism. My goal for Chapter 1  was to develop a portable ankle exoskeleton taking inspiration from the passive  elastic mechanisms at play in the human triceps surae-Achilles’ tendon complex  during walking.  The exoskeleton was designed to be as transparent to the user as possible  having minimal interference with gait kinematics and lightweight enough to minimize  the metabolic penalty of adding mass to the user. I designed the exoskeleton to  provide plantarflexion torque during stance, and not interfere with toe clearance  during swing. To do this I developed a lightweight custom composite frame and two  clutches that can engage and disengage a parallel spring based only on ankle  kinematic state. The primary system is purely passive containing no motors,  electronics or external power supply. A secondary clutch has an additional low  power, servomotor to control the timing of engagement of the clutch, which still  passively provides assistance but is more versatile and can handle dynamically  changing gait (e.g. increases in speed, asymmetry due to impairment).  To test the validity of our exoskeleton design I performed a variety of studies  of individuals walking in many conditions with and without the exoskeleton, on a split  belt instrumented treadmill. Kinetic, kinematic, electromyography, and oxygen  consumption and carbon dioxide expiration were recorded during all trials. Initial  testing of the exoskeleton in Chapter 1 suggests the utility of the clutch, to act in  series with the parallel spring. My results indicate the clutched exoskeleton design  addresses all three of our design criteria: (1) it does not hinder natural gait  kinematics, (2) it is lightweight enough so that added mass has minimal effect on net  metabolic energy consumption, and (3) it can produce significant plantarflexor torque  assistance during stance, but does not resist toe clearance during swing.","id":"94136b50-4dab-408b-ac63-60d566040788"}

Lum, William J. Shelstad, Megan H. Harris, & Matthew M. White Penn State Erie, The Behrend College  Traditionally, robotics are created to be user friendly from a human standpoint but recently a different theory has emerged which focuses on how the technology we use may influence how human-like we perceive each other to be. This study investigates how individual differences play in to someone’s propensity to technomorphize. The first focus was on whether those in an engineering or programming field were more likely to technomorphize than those in other fields. The second focus was to continue the validation process for the technomorphism scale and examine how machine-like humans may be perceived. Results from this study showed that those in an engineering field or programming field are more likely to technomorphize than those in different fields.  INTRODUCTION  Recently, scientists at the University of Washington have created the first human-to-human brain interface. Electrical signals coming from one human’s brain are recorded, translated by the computer and then transmitted to another brain that signals the second human to move their hand. According to researchers “When the move-right- hand signal arrived from Rao, Stocco involuntarily moved his right index finger to push the space bar on the keyboard in front of him, as if firing the cannon. He said the feeling of his hand moving involuntarily was like that of a nervous tic” (Begley, 2013).","id":"dc1a436d-a531-468c-8e4d-fbe182e88dbf"}

Atkeson2  Abstract—Learning controllers for bipedal robots is a chal- lenging problem, often requiring expert knowledge and exten- sive tuning of parameters that vary in different situations. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has shown promise at automatically learning controllers for complex systems in simulation. This has been followed by a push towards learning controllers that can be transferred between simulation and hardware, primarily with the use of domain randomization. However, domain randomization can make the problem of ﬁnding stable controllers even more challenging, especially for underactuated bipedal robots. In this work, we explore whether policies learned in simulation can be transferred to hardware with the use of high-ﬁdelity simulators and structured controllers. We learn a neural network policy which is a part of a more structured controller. While the neural network is learned in simulation, the rest of the controller stays ﬁxed, and can be tuned by the expert as needed. We show that using this approach can greatly speed up the rate of learning in simulation, as well as enable transfer of policies between simulation and hardware. We present our results on an ATRIAS robot and explore the effect of action spaces and cost functions on the rate of transfer between simulation and hardware. Our results show that structured policies can indeed be learned in simulation and implemented on hardware successfully. This has several advantages, as the structure preserves the intuitive nature of the policy, and the neural network improves the performance of the hand-designed policy. In this way, we propose a way of using neural networks to improve expert designed controllers, while maintaining ease of understanding.  Fig. 1: Our test platform is CMU’s ATRIAS robot in a planar setup.  [6] show that a variant of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [7] can learn to control a very high degree of free- dom humanoid robot in Mujoco, even in very challenging environments.

The neural circuitry that facilitates automaticity is impaired by stroke, resulting in a compensatory shift toward executive-control, as well as reduced paretic propulsion and increased step-to-step variability. We have developed a soft robotic exosuit to augment paretic propulsion by providing paretic plantarflexor assistance during the propulsive phase of walking. For this preliminary study, we hypothesized that changes in walking automaticity would accompany changes in paretic propulsion. When plantarflexor assistance timings were tuned to reduce propulsion variability—a biomechanical measure of automaticity—a -14.7±2.5% variability reduction was accompanied by increased paretic propulsion (%Δ:+6.4±6.3%) and prefrontal cortex activity (Δ oxygenated hemoglobin:+1.08E-04±1.05E-04 M mm). When plantarflexor assistance timings were instead tuned to reduce prefrontal cortex activity—a neurophysiological measure of automaticity—a -1.3E-05±1.1E-05 M mm decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin was accompanied by both increased paretic propulsion (%Δ:+4.4±8.1%) and reduced propulsion variability (%Δ:-3.7±19.3%). Biomechanical and neurophysiological measures of automaticity are sensitive to exosuit assistance timing changes, but are differentially affected, highlighting the need for individualized tuning. I. INTRODUCTION Human locomotor control ranges on a spectrum of automaticity; highly automatic control strategies require minimal cognitive resources, while executive control strategies are attention-demanding. The neural circuitry that enables walking automaticity largely consists of cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord; in contrast, executive control depends heavily on cortical brain regions, and more specifically, the prefrontal cortex. Typical healthy adult walking employs automatic control strategies that allow for simultaneous performance of cognitively demanding tasks, such as talking or thinking; executive control strategies are used during learning and performing highly complex tasks","id":"39f7e782-aeb3-490c-9d94-43c22921b861"}

Sawicki1,2,3*, Owen N. Beck1,2, Inseung Kang1 and Aaron J. Young1,3*  Abstract  Since the early 2000s, researchers have been trying to develop lower-limb exoskeletons that augment human mobility by reducing the metabolic cost of walking and running versus without a device. In 2013, researchers finally broke this ‘metabolic cost barrier’. We analyzed the literature through December 2019, and identified 23 studies that demonstrate exoskeleton designs that improved human walking and running economy beyond capable without a device. Here, we reviewed these studies and highlighted key innovations and techniques that enabled these devices to surpass the metabolic cost barrier and steadily improve user walking and running economy from 2013 to nearly 2020. These studies include, physiologically-informed targeting of lower-limb joints; use of off-board actuators to rapidly prototype exoskeleton controllers; mechatronic designs of both active and passive systems; and a renewed focus on human-exoskeleton interface design.

Our previous study presented a lightweight prosthesis with damping behav- iors, which can adapt to different terrains. However, the proposed prosthesis cannot provide push-off during the stance phase. In this paper, we redesigned the mechanical structure, combining push-off and damping behaviors. The Peking University Robotic Trantibial Prosthesis (PKU- RoboTPro-) II makes a trade-off between push-off power and lightweight. Three unilateral transtibial subjects partic- ipated in the study. Gait symmetry and metabolic cost of walking with the proposed prosthesis were evaluated under conditions of three terrains and four walking speeds. The gait symmetry of the subjects using the prosthesis com- bining push-off and damping behaviors in stance time and ground reaction force distribution are improved. Meanwhile, the PKU-RoboTPro-II with a push-off mode can reduce en- ergy expenditure, with an average 14% ± 8% reduction and a maximal 31% reduction under different conditions, com- pared with a non-push-off mode. When the weight of the lithium-ion rechargeable battery is 0.28 kg (2.6 Ah), it en- ables the new prosthesis combining push-off and damping behaviors to walk approximately 10 000 strides, on average.

Abstract Objective: To investigate the effects of an automated stride assistance device that assists hip joint ﬂexion and extension movement in energy expenditure during walking in healthy young adults using an expired gas method. Design: Prospective, single-group design to compare the differences of energy expenditure between 2 assistive conditions. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Healthy volunteers (NZ10) aged 21 to 32 years. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Oxygen consumption per unit time ( _VO2) cost (ml$kg1$m1), and heart rate (beats\/min) were measured in 2 assistive conditions (with 3-Nm hip motion assistance and without assistance) and at 2 walking speeds (comfortable walking speed [CWS] and maximum walking speed [MWS]). Results: There were no signiﬁcant differences in walking speed between the with- and without-assistance conditions at either the CWS or MWS. The _VO2 cost and heart rate were signiﬁcantly reduced in the with-assistance condition compared with the without-assistance condition, at both the CWS and MWS. The reduction in the _VO2 cost during the with-assistance condition, relative to the without-assistance condition, was 7.06% at the CWS and 10.52% at the MWS. Conclusions: The automated stride assistance device is useful for reducing energy expenditure during walking in healthy adults. Further studies are warranted to investigate if this device provides substantial help to individuals with impaired mobility as a result of strength deﬁcits.

Results: The mean oxygen uptake and heart rate during the last 30 s of ascending were 33.5  4.8 mL·kg1·min1 and 159  15 beats·min1, respectively. During the descent, oxygen uptake and heart rate during the last 30 s of the climb were 17.0  3.8 mL·kg1·min1 and 107  18 beats·min1, respectively. The estimated gross energy expended during ascending and descending were 19.7 and 9.0 kcal, or equivalent to an intensity of 9.6 and 4.9 metabolic equivalents (METs), respectively (or 10.2 and 5.2 kcal·min1, respectively). The caloric cost of stepping up and down a step was calculated to be 0.11 and 0.05 kcal, respectively. Conclusion: Stair-climbing exercise using a local public-access staircase met the minimum requirements for cardiorespiratory benefits and can therefore be considered a viable exercise for most people and suitable for promotion of physical activity.

Nowadays, the proper alignment of knee mechanical axis and the perfect equalization of ﬂexion and extension gaps are ensured by computer-assisted TKA (CATKA). Nevertheless, any residual im- balance of collateral ligaments at the time of surgery can lead to an excessive imbalance in the postoperative period during the weight- bearing activities, which subject the knee collateral ligaments to increased loading. This in turn leads to an accelerated polyethylene wear, and consequently, to early failure of TKA. The instrumented tibialimplantproposedinthisstudycanpostoperativelyassessand monitor the progression of residual postoperative ligament imbal- ance of a prosthetic knee, which is perfectly aligned during the surgery thanks to CATKA, via a center-of-pressure (COP)-based approach. This approach depends on the measurement of relative displacementofCOPpositionduringthepostoperativeperiodwith respect to a reference position recorded at the beginning of this pe- riod. This measurement is performed for six predetermined ﬂexion angles representative of an entire gait cycle. The tibial implant can also generate the electrical power in addition to their role in mon- itoring the COP position thanks to the piezoceramics embedded within the tibial tray to achieve this twofold task. Experimental and ﬁnite-element analysis (FEA) studies have been conducted to validate the methodology used for the postoperative assessment of residual knee laxity.

The typical weight burden often exceeds 40 kg which is beyond the recommended maximum load limits which lead to acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of a new device called “Dermoskeleton” designed to counterpart the acute and chronic impacts of the distributed overload bearing of dismounted soldiers in all their tasks, e.g. marching and fighting modes. The performance of the initial prototypes was evaluated experimentally using standardized quantitative aerobic and anaerobic tests. The evaluation protocol included two conditions (with and without the device), with three weight criteria (no weight, 25 lbs, 50 lbs), and three (3) short\/intense exercises tests: 1) performing the maximum amount of squats possible, 2) continuously climbing 3 flights of stairs for a period of 20 minutes and 3) conducting the Canadian Home Fitness Test (CHFT). The results showed a significant mechanical advantage (i.e. 48%) during the squat test. The current proof-of-concept prototype did not show a physiological benefit for stair climbing tasks but for one (1) participant. During the CHFT, the physiological effort with the device raised at about 5% to 10%. However, the participants perceived less physically exerting while loaded when using the dermoskeleton. The participants also noted that the system had considerable potential to enhance soldier mobility and reduce musculo-skeletal demands if key attributes of the system could be improved.  1.0 INTRODUCTION  1.1 The Challenge","id":"187abd90-7531-48a2-a6e8-4424786e6898"}

Lynch, Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—The ParkourBot climbs in a planar reduced-gravity vertical chute by leaping back and forth between the chute’s two parallel walls. The ParkourBot is comprised of a body with two springy legs and its controls consist of leg angles at touchdown and the energy stored in them. During ﬂight, the robot stores elastic potential energy in its springy legs and then converts this poten- tial energy in to kinetic energy at touchdown, when it “kicks off” a wall. This paper describes the ParkourBot’s mechanical design, modeling, and open-loop climbing experiments. The mechanical design makes use of the BowLeg, previously used for hopping on a ﬂat ground. We introduce two models of the BowLeg ParkourBot: one is based on a nonzero stance duration using the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, and the other is a simpliﬁed model (the simplest parkour model, or SPM) obtained as the leg stiffness ap- proaches inﬁnity and the stance time approaches zero. The SPM approximation provides the advantage of closed-form calculations. Finally, predictions of the models are validated by experiments in open-loop climbing in a reduced-gravity planar environment pro- vided by an air table.

More than 14 million individuals suffered from osteoarthritis of the knee is 2007 and 2008 in the United States[3].

Karen Liu2  Abstract—This paper introduces a new planning algorithm to minimize the damage of humanoid falls by utilizing multiple contact points. Given an unstable initial state of the robot, our approach plans for the optimal sequence of contact points such that the initial momentum is dissipated with minimal impacts on the robot. Instead of switching among a collection of individual control strategies, we propose a general algorithm which plans for appropriate responses to a wide variety of falls, from a single step to recover a gentle nudge, to a rolling motion to break a high-speed fall. Our algorithm transforms the falling problem into a sequence of inverted pendulum problems and use dynamic programming to solve the optimization efﬁciently. The planning algorithm is validated in physics simulation and experimentally tested on a BioloidGP humanoid.  I. INTRODUCTION  A humanoid in an interactive environment is often exposed to the risk of falling due to unexpected contacts or perturba- tions. A fall can potentially cause detrimental damage to the robot and enormous cost to repair.

Walsha,b,∗  aBiodesign Lab, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA bThe Wyss Institute for Biologically-Inspired Engineering, Cambridge, MA, USA  Abstract  Exoskeletons comprised of rigid load-bearing structures have been developed for many years, but a new paradigm is to create “exosuits” that apply tensile forces to the body using textiles and utilize the bodys skeletal structure to support compressive forces. Exosuits are intended to augment the musculature by providing small to moderate levels of assistance at appropriate times in the walking cycle. They have a number of substantial beneﬁts: with their fabric construction, exosuits eliminate problems of needing to align a rigid frame precisely with the biological joints and their inertia can be extremely low. In this paper, we present a fully portable hip-assistance exosuit that uses a backpack frame to attach to the torso, onto which is mounted a spooled-webbing actuator that connects to the back of the users thigh. The actuators, powered by a geared brushless motor connected to a spool via a timing belt, wind up seat-belt webbing onto the spool so that a large travel is possible with a simple, compact mechanism. Designed to be worn over the clothing, the webbing creates a large moment arm around the hip that provides torques in the sagittal plane of up to 30% of the nominal biological torques for level-ground walking. Due to its soft design, the system does not restrict the motion of the hip in the ab- and adduction directions or rotation about the leg axis. Here we present the design of the system along with some initial measurements of the system in use during walking on level ground at 1.25 m\/s, where it creates a force of up to 150 N on the thigh, equivalent to a torque of 20.5 Nm to assist hip extension.

Introduction  A large number of lower limb exoskeletons have been developed over the years, usually with the pur- pose of assisting or augmenting human walking. For individuals needing to carry heavy loads such as soldiers or recreational backpackers, the promise of a mechanical assist is welcoming, potentially reduc- ing muscle fatigue, metabolic expenditure, or injury rates. For individuals needing assistance with walk- ing such as the elderly or paraplegic, or patients requiring gait rehabilitation, such devices could po- tentially restore walking function.","id":"2c7946fc-db26-4fe4-9da6-f812cdfb8367"}

Agrawal, Member, IEEE  Abstract Gait disorders and subsequent falls are major causes of chronic disability. Most falls occur during walking when an individual fails to recover from a loss of balance. We have developed an innovative cable-driven robot that delivers unpredictable waist-pull perturbations while walking on a treadmill. In previous experiments, we showed that a training induces acute motor session with repeated waist-pulls adaptations in gait and balance recovery reactions. To date, it is unknown if the effects can be transferred to different types of external balance perturbations.  This study aims to investigate if the exposure to repeated waist-pulls can improve the recovery reactions to slips. Fourteen healthy young adults were assigned to either an Experimental (EG) or a Control Group (CG). The EG was trained with multidirectional waist-pull perturbations of various intensities. The CG walked for a comparable amount of time on the treadmill with cables on, but without experiencing any waist- pull. Before and after the training, all participants were exposed to three slip-like perturbations by suddenly accelerating one belt of the treadmill in the forward direction. The Margin of Stability (MoS) was evaluated while reacting to the perturbations. At post-training, the EG showed increased stability in reaction to the waist-pull and slip-like perturbations. In contrast, the reaction to slip-like disturbances of the CG remained unchanged. A single session of gait training comprised of repeated waist-pulls showed immediate transfer to split-belt treadmill slips. The findings of this pilot study are encouraging for developing new fall prevention therapies.  I.

Moreover, even if we take one of these perturbations, the final effect on the human body is often unpredictable, because it depends on the amplitude, direction and timing of the disturbance [9, 10].","id":"0741eae2-2622-43f0-ba24-49fea939d855"}

Humans can generate diverse locomotion behaviors through the hierarchical control of the supraspinal and the spinal systems, where the spinal control is often assumed to consist of central pattern generators and reﬂexes. It has been demonstrated through simulation that human walking and running can be generated with control models where the central pattern generator is controlled in a hierarchical structure. How- ever, no reﬂex control model in such framework has been proposed. Here we propose that locomotion behaviors can be controlled by a hierarchical control structure where the supraspinal system modulates reﬂexes with simple signals. We demonstrate in physics simulation that a simple neu- romuscular model with a hierarchical reﬂex control can regulate running speed and height on unknown terrains with height diﬀerences of ±10cm.  1  Introduction  Humans exhibit agile locomotion behaviors such as altering the locomotion speed and jumping over obstacles as needed. It is widely recognized that such behaviors are realized through a hierarchical control structure consisting of the supraspinal and the spinal control layer [1]. Spinal locomotion of decerebrated cats [2] and other vertebrates [3,4] demonstrates that large part of the control of normal locomotion is conducted in the spinal cord. To intentionally control locomotion behaviors based on environmental cues, it is necessary to modulate the spinal control through the supraspinal system. Therefore, understanding the mecha- nism of the spinal control and how it interacts with the supraspinal control is essential for explaining how legged locomotion is governed in biological systems. Diﬀerent types of human neuromuscular control models have demonstrated stable bipedal locomotion in physics simulation [5–8]. In a previous study, we have shown with a 3D human neuromuscular model that a reﬂex-based spinal control can generate diverse locomotion behaviors, including walking and run- ning, slope and stair negotiation, and deliberate obstacle avoidance [8]. Each be- havior has been generated with diﬀerent set of spinal control parameters, leaving unexplained how the diﬀerent sets can be stored and selected by the supraspinal system. In this study, we explore a simple solution of building a lookup table by mapping, in prior, all relevant states and control parameter sets. To this end,","id":"a8b18d4c-f3d1-4f81-9a54-11215bea7696"}

Given the heterogeneity of gait patterns in children with cerebral palsy (CP), the sensor placement and analysis algorithm may inﬂuence the validity of the results. This study aimed at comparing the spatiotemporal measurement performances of three wearable conﬁgurations deﬁned by different sensor positioning on the lower limbs: (1) shanks and thighs, (2) shanks, and (3) feet. The three conﬁgurations were selected based on their potential to be used in daily life for children with CP and typically developing (TD) controls. For each conﬁguration, dedicated gait analysis algorithms were used to detect gait events and compute spatiotemporal parameters. Fifteen children with CP and 11 TD controls were included. Accuracy, precision, and agreement of the three conﬁgurations were determined in comparison with an optoelectronic system as a reference. The three conﬁgurations were comparable for the evaluation of TD children and children with a low level of disability (CP-GMFCS I) whereas the shank-and-thigh-based conﬁguration was more robust regarding children with a higher level of disability (CP-GMFCS II–III).

It incorporates an energy-efﬁcient clutch mechanism activated by a mini servo- motor which engages and disengages the spring that supports the leg during running. The exoskeleton extracts energy during the running phase when the muscles are acting as brakes (negative power), stores it in the spring, and then returns this energy during the positive power phase (when the muscles are acting as motors).

The ratio of the consumed servo energy consumption to the subjects’ saved energy was 1:160 (0.1W input to 16W saved).

INTRODUCTION  E LECTRO mechanical wearable exoskeletons are designed  to assist human motion and mobility in numerous contexts [1]. Exoskeletons were ﬁrst developed in the 1960s and are used today to increase the weight-bearing capacity [2] of individuals with disabilities [3], lower energy expenditure when walking [4], [5] and running [6], [7], [8], harvest energy while walking [9], [10], [11], increase jump height [12], and other uses.  fatigue over extended periods of time. Passive exoskeletons use mechanical components such as springs and dampers to provide assistance without an external power source. This typically makes them lightweight and energy-efﬁcient and better suited for prolonged use [4].

A person with a healthy knee can able to walk freely without any pain in the knee joint but factors like ageing, osteoarthritis can damage the meniscus, articular cartilage and can cause increased compression between the bone which results in knee pain. This compression between the bones can be reduced by extending the knee joint which can provide pain relief. In this proposed method, an exoskeleton knee extension system for transferring the whole-body weight to shoe and an actuating mechanism is designed to extend the knee joint. NodeMCU ESP8266 controller is used to receive feedback from the load cell to drive the motor which provides extension. Only a prototype of is proposed. The necessary extension device extension has been achieved with this prototype and it lifted up to 17 kg. The placements of cuff in the thigh and shank region provided proper grip such that the upper body weight is transferred to the shoe. This is a prototype model and it can be further developed into a clinical device and the extension in the knee joint can be tested by proper clinical trials in future.

This study aimed to profile gait pathology in gait-impaired patients with MS using comprehensive 3D gait analysis and clinical walking tests. Thirty-seven patients with MS walked on the treadmill at their individual, sustainable speed while 20 healthy control subjects walked at all the different patient’s paces, allowing for comparisons independent of walking velocity. Kinematic analysis revealed pronounced restrictions in knee and ankle joint excursion, increased gait variability and asymmetry along with impaired dynamic stability in patients. The most discriminative single gait parameter, differentiating patients from controls with an accuracy of 83.3% (χ2 test; p = 0.0001), was reduced knee range of motion. Based on hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis, three principal pathological gait patterns were identified: a spastic-paretic, an ataxia-like, and an unstable gait. Follow-up assessments after 1 year indicated deterioration of walking function, particularly in patients with spastic-paretic gait patterns. Our findings suggest that impaired knee\/ankle control is common in patients with MS.

Patient preference, a formalized representation of “what patients want”, provides an efficient method for identifying appropriate prosthesis mechanics. Unfortunately, a lack of the scientific and technological tools necessary to formally measure and rigorously understand preference has led to limitations in ascertaining its role in the prescription process. In this study, our objective was to understand how preference changes with walking speed and how preference corresponds to clinical metrics of gait performance. We characterized preferred stiffness of the Variable Stiffness Prosthetic Ankle Foot (VSPA Foot) across speeds in persons with below knee amputation. We then assessed metabolic expenditure and performance in the ten-meter walk test at several stiffness values around the preferred stiffness. Preferred stiffness did not correlate with body mass, and was lower at the self-selected treadmill walking speed than at either the fast or slow speeds. There was a significant increase in self-selected overground speed in the ten meter walk test at stiffness values at or above the preferred stiffness. Changes to prosthetic ankle stiffness within +\/- 30% of the preferred stiffness did not significantly affect metabolic expenditure. These results indicate that preferred stiffness may be associated with significant changes in self-selected overground walking speed (p < 0.001), and may not be driven by metabolic optimality (p > 0.93). This outcome motivates future work to identify other potential drivers of preference, including biomechanical correlates of gait, and highlights the potential value of formally incorporating patient preference into the clinical prescription process. I. INTRODUCTION The current prescription paradigm for commercial lower-extremity prostheses is hampered by a lack of robust metrics to identify optimal clinical solutions. In parallel with shaping a socket, prosthetists work with patients to select appropriate prosthetic componentry. Experience, including trial-and-error methodologies, play a substantial role in selecting and adjusting these components.

Gregg , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Goal: Accounting for gait individuality is im- portant to positive outcomes with wearable robots, but manually tuning multi-activity models is time-consuming and not viable in a clinic. Generalizations can possibly be made to predict gait individuality in unobserved conditions. Methods: Kinematic individuality—how one person’s joint angles differ from the group—is quantiﬁed for every sub- ject, joint, ambulation mode (walking, running, stair ascent, and stair descent), and intramodal task (speed, incline) in an open-access dataset with 10 able-bodied subjects. Four N-way ANOVAs test how prediction methods affect the ﬁt to experimental data between and within ambulation modes. We test whether walking individuality (measured at a single speed on level ground) carries across modes, or whether a mode-speciﬁc prediction (based on a single task for each mode) is signiﬁcantly more effective. Results: Kinematic individualization improves ﬁt across joint and task if we consider each mode separately. Across all modes, tasks, and joints, modal individualization improved the ﬁt in 81% of trials, improving the ﬁt on average by 4.3◦ across the gait cycle. This was statistically signiﬁcant at all joints for walk- ing and running, and half the joints for stair ascent\/descent. Conclusions: For walking and running, kinematic individu- ality can be easily generalized within mode, but the trends are mixed on stairs depending on joint.  Index Terms—Biomechanics, gait recognition, assistive  devices, assistive robots.  Impact Statement— Isolating what makes gait unique for a person during activities of daily living allows us to gen- eralize movement individuality, making assistive devices easier to implement.  I.

Yet, little is known about how the prosthesis mechanics\/control inﬂu- ence wearer-prosthesis’ gait performance, such as gait symmetry, stability, etc. This study aimed to investigate the inﬂuence of robotic transfemoral prosthesis mechanics on human wearers’ gait symmetry. The investigation was enabled by our previously designed reinforcement learning (RL) supplementary control, which simultaneously tuned 12 control parameters that deter- mined the prosthesis mechanics throughout a gait cycle. The RL control design facilitated safe explorations of prosthesis mechanics with the human in the loop. Subjects were recruited and walked with a robotic transfemoral prosthesis on a treadmill while the RL controller tuned the control parameters. Stance time symmetry, step length symmetry, and bilateral anteroposterior (AP) impulses were measured. The data analysis showed that changes in robotic knee mechanics led to movement variations in both lower limbs and therefore gait temporal-spatial symmetry measures. Consistent across all inter-limb AP impulse measurements explained gait symmetry: the stance time symmetry was signiﬁcantly correlated with the net inter-limb AP impulse, and the step length symmetry was signiﬁcantly correlated with braking and propulsive impulse symmetry. The results suggest that it is possible to personalize transfemoral prosthesis control for improved temporal-spatial gait symmetry.

Agrawal, Member, IEEE  Abstract Gait disorders and subsequent falls are major causes of chronic disability. Most falls occur during walking when an individual fails to recover from a loss of balance. We have developed an innovative cable-driven robot that delivers unpredictable waist-pull perturbations while walking on a treadmill. In previous experiments, we showed that a training induces acute motor session with repeated waist-pulls adaptations in gait and balance recovery reactions. To date, it is unknown if the effects can be transferred to different types of external balance perturbations.  This study aims to investigate if the exposure to repeated waist-pulls can improve the recovery reactions to slips. Fourteen healthy young adults were assigned to either an Experimental (EG) or a Control Group (CG). The EG was trained with multidirectional waist-pull perturbations of various intensities. The CG walked for a comparable amount of time on the treadmill with cables on, but without experiencing any waist- pull. Before and after the training, all participants were exposed to three slip-like perturbations by suddenly accelerating one belt of the treadmill in the forward direction. The Margin of Stability (MoS) was evaluated while reacting to the perturbations. At post-training, the EG showed increased stability in reaction to the waist-pull and slip-like perturbations. In contrast, the reaction to slip-like disturbances of the CG remained unchanged. A single session of gait training comprised of repeated waist-pulls showed immediate transfer to split-belt treadmill slips. The findings of this pilot study are encouraging for developing new fall prevention therapies.  I. INTRODUCTION  can be induced by a variety of external perturbations, e.g., tripping, slipping, misstep, incorrect weight shifting, collisions, etc. [2]. Moreover, even if we take one of these perturbations, the final effect on the human body is often unpredictable, because it depends on the amplitude, direction and timing of the disturbance [9, 10].","id":"0741eae2-2622-43f0-ba24-49fea939d855"}

It can start with a small structure and gradually increase hidden layer nodes through the supervision mechanism. Broad learning system (BLS), as a novel structure, has been widely used in various fields because of its high efficiency, generalization performance and scalability. Unlike deep learning models, BLS is proposed based on random vector functional link network (RVFLN) which can map input features to a more appropriate feature space and the mapped features are enhanced as enhancement nodes. Therefore, to enhance the feature learning ability and improve the effectiveness of SCN, inspired by BLS architecture, a novel broad stochastic configuration network (BSCN) is proposed, then we give the structure and theory of BSCN. In this model, the original features are transformed into mapping features in the feature layer and the mapping features are enhanced in the enhancement layer, then the input weights and biases of enhancement nodes are determined according to the supervision mechanism and the output weight matrix can be calculated through the standard least squares. The experimental results on function approximation problems and real-world datasets indicate that BSCN improves the performance of SCN, and it has higher regression accuracy and stability.  © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a knee exoskeleton rehabilitation robot driven by a quasi-direct driver actuator is designed. The torque generation model is constructed based on the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network, and the knee joint torque is generated by sEMG and angle signal. A joint attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of torque generation model. The impedance control parameters are adaptively adjusted in accordance with the joint torque. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network is capable of effectively estimating torque, the mean MAE and CC of the proposed model are 1.141Nm and 93.7%, respectively. The optimized impedance control can optimize the initial value of the impedance parameter, which reduced the torque error by 5.54% and 50.64% at uphill tasks and walking task, respectively, and adaptively adjust the impedance parameter to ensure the coordination of the gait rehabilitation and the friendly human- robot interaction.

Gregg , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—This article presents the design and validation of a backdrivable powered knee orthosis for partial assis- tance of lower-limb musculature, which aims to facilitate daily activities in individuals with musculoskeletal disor- ders. The actuator design is guided by design principles that prioritize backdrivability, output torque, and compact- ness. First, we show that increasing the motor diameter while reducing the gear ratio for a ﬁxed output torque ul- timately reduces the reﬂected inertia (and thus backdrive torque). We also identify a tradeoff with actuator torque density that can be addressed by improving the motor’s thermal environment, motivating our design of a custom brushless dc motor with encapsulated windings. Finally, by designing a 7:1 planetary gearset directly into the stator, the actuator has a high package factor that reduces size and weight. Benchtop tests verify that the custom actua- tor can produce at least 23.9-N · m peak torque and 12.78- N · m continuous torque, yet has less than 2.68-N · m back- drive torque during walking conditions. Able-bodied human subject experiments (N = 3) demonstrate reduced quadri- cep activation with bilateral orthosis assistance during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing.

Young  Abstract—Estimating biological joint moments using wearable sensors could enable out-of-lab biomechanical analyses and exoskeletons that assist throughout daily life. To realize these possibilities, this study introduced a subject-independent hip moment estimator using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) and validated its performance and generalizability during multimodal ambulation. Electrogoniometer and simulated IMU data from sixteen participants walking on level ground, ramps and stairs were used to evaluate our approach when benchmarked against a fully-connected neural network, a long short-term memory network, and a baseline method (i.e., using subject- average moment curves based on ambulation mode and gait phase). Additionally, the generalizability of our approach was evaluated by testing on ground slopes, stair heights, and gait training. The TCN transitions withheld during model outperformed the benchmark approaches on the hold-out data (p<0.05), with an average RMSE of 0.131±0.018 Nm\/kg and R2 of 0.880±0.030 during steady-state ambulation. When tested on the 20 leave-one-out slope and stair height conditions, the TCN significantly increased RMSE only on the steepest (+18°) incline (p<0.05). Finally, the TCN RMSE and R2 was 0.152±0.027 Nm\/kg and 0.786±0.055, respectively, during mode transitions. Thus, our approach accurately estimated hip moment and generalized to unseen gait contexts using data from three wearable sensors.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Exosuits have the potential to assist locomotion in both healthy and pathological populations, but the effect of exosuit assistance on the underlying muscle-tendon tissue loading is not yet understood. In this study, we used shear wave tensiometers to characterize the modulation of Achilles tendon force with load carriage and exosuit assistance at the ankle. When walking (1.25 m\/s) unassisted on a treadmill with load carriage weights of 15 and 30% of body weight, peak Achilles tendon force increased by 11 and 23%, respectively. Ankle exosuit assistance significantly reduced peak Achilles tendon force relative to unassisted, although the magnitude of change was variable across participants. Peak Achilles tendon force was significantly correlated with peak ankle torque for unassisted walking across load carriage conditions. However, when ankle plantarflexor assistance was applied, the relationship between peak tendon force and peak biological ankle torque was no longer significant. An outdoor pilot study was conducted in which a wearable shear wave tensiometer was used to measure Achilles tendon wave speed and compare across an array of assistance loading profiles. Reductions in tendon loading varied depending on the profile, highlighting the importance of in vivo measurements of muscle and tendon forces when studying and optimizing exoskeletons and exosuits.","id":"17a2b728-6e01-4dd7-b938-f5ea82898148"}

The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations that takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. To emulate the adaptation skill of as- sisted human gait, human-robot interactive dynamics should be considered during optimization procedures. Most previous studies have only considered the normal gait for healthy people [5] and also they have not considered the human- robot interaction [6].  I. INTRODUCTION  Pathological gait patterns are observed in patients or elderly with gait disorders. For example, steppage gait occurs as a result of trying to compensate for the weakened ankle dorsiﬂexion. This compensation strategy with excessively ﬂexed hip and knee joints is used to clear the foot from the ground. Staggering gait occurs in post-stroke patients due imbalance caused from paretic limb.  Because their gait patterns are clearly different from a normal gait pattern. When using a robotic exoskeleton to assist their walking, they need a personalized assist pat- tern that is customized speciﬁc to their walking pattern to minimize mismatched assistive forces. When adjusting the control parameters for the assist pattern, the use of brute force search should be minimal to save time and effort. Gait simulation based approach can be a good alternative to provide assistance strategy guidelines for different gait types.","id":"48cdb2d4-9429-4a1a-9cfd-9bb81c7c55a1"}

Compared with the muscle, the ankle joint produced relatively similar moments across the walking tasks and participants. Changes in ankle power were more similar to the estimated muscle response across walking speeds (Fig. 3A, figs. S2 and S3, table S2). This is likely reflective of increased angular velocity and may suggest that the force generated during concentric contraction of the muscle is primarily directed at increasing joint velocity when modulating walking speed. However, ankle power did not follow the same trend as the muscle for incline walking. The largest disparity between the joint (+13% increase in peak ankle moment and +19% in peak ankle power compared with level) and the estimated muscle force (+92%) happens in incline walking. This is expected as the muscle must produce more work to add energy to the center of mass to overcome gravity, rather than relying upon passive energy storage and return. These data suggest that there may be different neuromuscular strategies that individuals develop depending on tasks and on variability in physiologic features such as tendon stiffness (68, 69), that in the end result in more similar response to the external environment at the joint level.  Our data found no correlation between peak MBA exosuit torque (non-mass normalized) and body mass in contrast to the established positive correlation between peak ankle moment (non- mass normalized) and body mass (70). Because of this relationship between ankle moment and body mass, assistance profiles are often scaled to the participant body mass (15, 20, 37, 40, 50). However, our data suggest that individual underlying physiology can be complicated and nonintuitive, and that assistance strategies should consider the underlying physiology and task- specific demands at the muscle level.","id":"ecea4ff8-879a-426d-9bb4-f441f9e5fc53"}

D. Howe, C. J. Walsh*  Variability in human walking depends on individual physiology, environment, and walking task. Consequently, in the field of wearable robotics, there is a clear need for customizing assistance to the user and task. Here, we developed a muscle-based assistance (MBA) strategy wherein exosuit assistance was derived from direct mea- surements of individuals’ muscle dynamics during specific tasks. We recorded individuals’ soleus muscle dynam- ics using ultrasonographic imaging during multiple walking speeds and inclines. From these prerecorded images, we estimated the force produced by the soleus through inefficient concentric contraction and designed the exo- suit assistance profile to be proportional to that estimated force. We evaluated this approach with a bilateral ankle exosuit at each measured walking task. Compared with not wearing a device, the MBA ankle exosuit significantly −1 , reduced metabolic demand by an average of 15.9, 9.7, and 8.9% for level walking at 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 meters second at 5.71° incline while applying lower assistance levels than in existing respectively, and 7.8% at 1.25 meters second literature. In an additional study (n = 2), we showed for multiple walking tasks that the MBA profile outperforms other bioinspired strategies and the average profile from a previous optimization study. Last, we show the feasibility of online assistance generation in a mobile version for overground outdoor walking. This muscle-based approach enables relatively rapid (~10 seconds) generation of individualized low-force assistance profiles that provide metabolic benefit. This approach may help support the adoption of wearable robotics in real-world, dynamic locomotor tasks by enabling comfortable, tailored, and adaptive assistance.  −1","id":"1cb8cfd4-960f-425c-ae14-3a66e510aea6"}

Rouse, Member, IEEE, Levi J. Hargrove, Member, IEEE, Eric J. Perreault, Member, IEEE, and Todd A. Kuiken, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Human joint impedance is the dynamic relationship between the differential change in the position of a perturbed joint and the corresponding response torque; it is a fundamental property that governs how humans interact with their environ- ments. It is critical to characterize ankle impedance during the stance phase of walking to elucidate how ankle impedance is reg- ulated during locomotion, as well as provide the foundation for future development of natural, biomimetic powered prostheses and their control systems. In this study, ankle impedance was estimated using a model consisting of stiffness, damping and in- ertia. Ankle torque was well described by the model, accounting % of the variance. When averaged across subjects, for the stiffness component of impedance was found to increase linearly from 1.5 to 6.5 Nm\/rad\/kg between 20% and 70% of stance phase. The damping component was found to be statisti- cally greater than zero only for the estimate at 70% of stance phase, with a value of 0.03 Nms\/rad\/kg. The slope of the ankle’s torque-angle curve—known as the quasi-stiffness—was not sta- tistically different from the ankle stiffness values, and showed remarkable similarity. Finally, using the estimated impedance, the speciﬁcations for a biomimetic powered ankle prosthesis were introduced that would accurately emulate human ankle impedance during locomotion.  I.

In order to it is crucial to guarantee achieve high performance robots, harmonious integration between software and hardware. Hence, the development of such capable robotic platforms must address design requirements that meet the assumptions of typical model- based controllers but also respect the physical limitations of a real system. First, we show that proper hardware design choices can greatly aid the control algorithm by approximating the physical robot to the template assumptions. We include actuation and sensing design examples that allows a simple model to capture a major portion of the natural dynamic behavior of the physical machine. Results are applied to a real robot (Figure 1) and we show that the adopted methodology is able to address typical problems in legged robots such as high bandwidth force control and robustness to impact. Finally, a simple model-based balance controller that takes advantage of the ﬁdelity of the template model to the real machine is implemented. These are examples of software-hardware co- design processes that vastly facilitate robotic control.  I. INTRODUCTION  To build legged machines capable of dynamic physical interactions with the environment remains as one of the great challenges in the robotics ﬁeld. These interactions consist of complex dynamic phenomena that involve the control algorithm, the hardware and the outside world. Hence, it is clear that the development of dynamic legged robots should tightly integrate the reasoning process of both software and hardware. The design of both sides should mutually adapt the characteristics and constrains in order to maximize the synergy between the two domains.","id":"cf7a372b-bcd8-4dd3-902e-ed9db3cb2cce"}

Although some studies have studied the effects of using rehabilitation exoskeletons for patients rehabilitation, the improvement of patient gait quality with a single knee exoskeleton has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, a deep neural network-based biological torque controller is presented for real-time control of the unilateral knee exoskeleton. The aim was to improve the gait quality of patients by enhancing their gait symmetry. A lightweight unilateral knee exoskeleton system with low passive impedance and well transparent was used to develop and validate the controller during both treadmill and level walking modes. The proposed control strategy is characterized by accurate assisted output torque even when the motion pattern is changed, and does not require controller parameter adjustment. To test it, five able-bodied subjects used an exoskeleton with an artificial blocking device at the knee joint position that simulated the patient ’ s defective postoperative pathological gait( i.e., reduced knee flexion). The subjects walked continuously on a treadmill and a flat surface. The experimental results demonstrated that the control strategy effectively improved the gait quality of the participants.

INTRODUCTION  Deep learning-based architectures have triggered many real-world applications such as face detection and recognition, blur image identi- ﬁcation, mandible segmentation, and speaker recognition. In general, the gradient descent is employed in tuning parameters of deep learning totrain model, and itusually need more time than expected, which have severely restricted their development.  In order to improve the generalization ability and reduce the training timeofneuralnetwork,ChenandLiu[1]proposebroadlearningsystem (BLS), which is based on the notion of random vector functional-link neural network (RVFLNN) [2]. BLS provides more ﬂexible access network and ﬂat network architecture. The parameters of feature nodes and enhancement nodes are randomly generated in the procedure of network initialization, and they are ﬁxed without any adjustment in the process of network training. All nodes of network can connect directly with the output. The ridge regression theory is used to calculate output weight of BLS. The outstanding advantage of BLS is that it can ﬁnd the globaloptimalsolution.Moreover,regularizationmethods,whichmake the results close to the true value, can effectively inhibit the distortion. In addition, it can increase feature nodes and enhancement nodes dynamically depending upon the residual error of network without retraining network.","id":"2dc97d0f-5902-4bc7-b903-f14d69907791"}

Gregg2,3  Abstract—This paper presents the design and validation of a backdrivable powered knee orthosis for partial assistance of lower-limb musculature, which aims to facilitate daily activities in individuals with musculoskeletal disorders. The actuator design is guided by design principles that prioritize backdrivability, output torque, and compactness. First, we show that increasing the motor diameter while reducing the gear ratio for a ﬁxed output torque ultimately reduces the reﬂected inertia (and thus back- drive torque). We also identify a tradeoff with actuator torque density that can be addressed by improving the motor’s thermal environment, motivating our design of a custom Brushless DC motor with encapsulated windings. Finally, by designing a 7:1 planetary gearset directly into the stator, the actuator has a high package factor that reduces size and weight. Benchtop tests verify that the custom actuator can produce at least 23.9 Nm peak torque and 12.78 Nm continuous torque, yet has less than 2.68 Nm backdrive torque during walking conditions. Able- bodied human subjects experiments (N=3) demonstrate reduced quadriceps activation with bilateral orthosis assistance during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. The minimal transmission also produces negligible acoustic noise.  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"752f89a2-7883-4b42-b21a-f9cd6eb772a1"}

In this study, we used shear wave tensiometers to characterize the modulation of Achilles tendon force with load carriage and exosuit assistance at the ankle. When walking (1.25 m\/s) unassisted on a treadmill with load carriage weights of 15 and 30% of body weight, peak Achilles tendon force increased by 11 and 23%, respectively. Ankle exosuit assistance significantly reduced peak Achilles tendon force relative to unassisted, although the magnitude of change was variable across participants. Peak Achilles tendon force was significantly correlated with peak ankle torque for unassisted walking across load carriage conditions. However, when ankle plantarflexor assistance was applied, the relationship between peak tendon force and peak biological ankle torque was no longer significant. An outdoor pilot study was conducted in which a wearable shear wave tensiometer was used to measure Achilles tendon wave speed and compare across an array of assistance loading profiles.

This physical system illustrates another simple model, the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP); a popular template for legged robot control and, in this letter, the mapping channel between the operator and robot. We develop a scaling strategy based on geometric and kinematic similarity in order to generate dynamically feasible trajectories for the LIP with a natural frequency different than the human’s. Moreover, by modifying the classic equations for the Cart-Pole, we show how it can competently represent the proposed template quantitatively and visually. Experiments where a human operator dynamically controls slave systems with slower or faster natural frequencies illustrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed method. This study is a step toward building a human–machine interface that dynamically synchronize operator and legged robot in order to eventually achieve complex motor behaviors.

The ﬁrst study revealed a close relationship between the ambulatory andthe reference systems.Compared to the reference system, the ambulatory system hadan overall sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 98% and 97%, respectively. In the second study, the ambulatory system also showed a very high sensitivity (>94%) in identifying a 50 stairs ascent from walking on the ﬂat and walking downstairs.

Article deals with the analysis of design exoskeleton for people with disabilities, in order to analyze significant events that are currently crucial in the creation or modification of various visual styles in design. The exoskeleton is carryable robotic device connected to the human body. Its design and of course its functionality modified and improved in time. Aesthetics of exoskeletons was influenced by on which elements they are based in designing - the predominance of a particular element decides how it is eventually perceived. An important part of creating ideas is to establish criteria that will set the direction and certain limits. The objective is also to find the most important connectins of shape, color and material features that make up a coherent design. Introduction The English word design is derived from the Latin de-signare, meaning to mark or indicate and in time the terms such as a proposal or to design were implemented. The aim of the design is to link the functional and aesthetic aspects of the proposed device in the most rational way, which requires technical and artistic skills and knowledge. The design is extremely varied, vital and ever-changing issue, different categories of which are complementary. It is present in many forms from useful and beautiful objects to waste, air pollution, disposal of mineral resources, transportation and environmental collapse, but it may help the sick, the elderly and handicapped. The presence of design is all around us. Initial impression For simple assessment the criteria of excellence of design we do not need to be experts in the field. Each of us is able to conclude whether a particular aesthetic appearance of the object acts upon us positively or negatively. If the effect is negative, there is sometning wrong in the proposal. The designer would therefore cooperate in the process of creating the draft not only with constructor, but also with doctor, psychologist and other professionals dealing fox example with physiology.

Quintero, Member, IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes a powered lower-limb orthosis that is intended to provide gait assistance to spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals by providing assistive torques at both hip and knee joints. The orthosis has a mass of 12 kg and is capable of providing maximum joint torques of 40 Nm with hip and knee joint ranges of motion from 105 ﬂexion to 30 extension and 105 ﬂexion to 10 hyperextension, respectively. A custom distributed embedded system controls the orthosis with power being provided by a lithium polymer battery which provides power for one hour of continuous walking. In order to demonstrate the ability of the orthosis to assist walking, the orthosis was experimentally imple- mented on a paraplegic subject with a T10 complete injury. Data collected during walking indicates a high degree of step-to-step re- peatabilityofhipandkneetrajectories(asenforcedbytheorthosis) and an average walking speed of 0.8 km\/hr. The electrical power required at each hip and knee joint during gait was approximately 25 and 27 W, respectively, contributing to the 117 W overall elec- trical power required by the device during walking. A video of walking corresponding to the aforementioned data is included in the supplemental material.

This high metabolic cost may be explained by the inability of available passive prostheses to replicate the biomechanics of intact legs during walking. Powered prostheses promise to address this issue by imitating the power generation of intact legs. Several studies have investigated the effect of power generation and energy injection at the ankle joint in transtibial amputees. In contrast, no study has directly addressed knee power generation in transfemoral amputees. This study investigates the effect of knee power generation in late stance in one transfemoral amputee subject using a lightweight powered prosthesis. Experimental results suggest that injecting positive energy into the gait cycle at the knee level may improve gait ability by reducing effort. I. INTRODUCTION Lower-limb amputation affects mobility and causes secondary health effects such as back pain and osteoarthritis [1]. Experimental studies show that amputees expend significantly more energy than able-bodied individuals to ambulate due to the compensatory movements that are required, for example, to accelerate their center of mass forward [2]. These issues can largely be attributed to the limitations of most prosthesis technologies, which rely on passive components such as mechanical springs and dampers, therefore are unable to actively generate power and inject energy into the gait cycle as intact legs would [3]. These limitations are being addressed by using battery-operated servomotors that can actively regulate joint torque and energy to more closely imitate the biomechanics of intact legs. Able-bodied studies suggest that positive power is a crucial part of the gait cycle [3]. Positive power provides energy to accelerate the body’s center of mass forward at the end of stance as well as to accelerate the leg into swing, thus providing clearance and preparing the leg for the next step. Focusing on the knee joint, both positive and negative power phases occur in stance phase [4]. When the body weight is accepted after heel-strike, power is absorbed by the knee flexion. This negative energy is then returned to positive energy as the knee transitions to extension in mid-stance. In late stance, the knee generates positive power to initiate knee flexion and accelerate the leg into swing. Powered prostheses can imitate the power generation phases of intact legs thanks Sarah A","id":"26004441-1361-4bfd-8d6e-b6b7b534fa77"}

Received: 9 August 2018; Accepted: 8 September 2018; Published: 11 September 2018    Abstract: Exoskeleton robots demonstrate promise in their application in assisting or enhancing human physical capacity. Joint muscular torques (JMT) reﬂect human effort, which can be applied on an exoskeleton robot to realize an active power-assist function. The estimation of human JMT with a wearable exoskeleton is challenging. This paper proposed a novel human lower limb JMT estimation method based on the inverse dynamics of the human body. The method has two main parts: the inverse dynamic approach (IDA) and the sensing system. We solve the inverse dynamics of each human leg separately to shorten the serial chain and reduce computational complexity, and divide the JMT into the mass-induced one and the foot-contact-force (FCF)-induced one to avoid switching the dynamic equation due to different contact states of the feet. An exoskeleton embedded sensing system is designed to obtain the user’s motion data and FCF required by the IDA by mapping motion information from the exoskeleton to the human body. Compared with the popular electromyography (EMG) and wearable sensor based solutions, electrodes, sensors, and complex wiring on the human body are eliminated to improve wearing convenience. A comparison experiment shows that this method produces close output to a motion analysis system with different subjects in different motion.

Passive orthoses are clinically available to provide support and promote the use of upper extremities in this population. However, these orthoses only position the torso passively without any degree of trunk movement.  We introduce for the ﬁrst time a novel active-assistive torso brace called Wheelchair Robot for Active Postural Support (WRAPS). It consists of two rings over the hips and chest connected by a 2RPS-2UPS parallel robotic device. WRAPS can modulate the displacement of the upper ring and\/or the forces applied on the torso through the ring in four degrees-of-freedom (DOF), including rotations and translation in the sagittal and frontal planes.  In the present study, we evaluate the design of WRAPS and its functions. Moreover, we discuss the potential effectiveness of WRAPS as a therapeutic robotic tool in people with severe trunk con- trol deﬁcits. The performance of WRAPS was evaluated in seated healthy subjects. Kinematics and surface electromyography (sEMG) were collected when the participants performed selective trunk movements. First, the torso range of motion (tROM) was calculated with WRAPS in transparent mode—zero-force control mode—which was compared with free-guided tROM (no WRAPS) with motion capture system. Second, a position control mode was conﬁgured to mobilize the torso along the trajectories obtained with the transparent mode.","id":"d81169a7-26ac-4d00-81ec-0d4f54a8ee33"}

Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009;90: 136-44.  Objectives: To test the hypothesis that reducing vertical center of mass (COM) displacement will lower the metabolic cost of human walking. To examine changes in joint work associated with increasing and decreasing vertical COM move- ment during gait.  Design: Randomized repeated measures. Setting: Human Neuromechanics Laboratory, University of  Michigan.  Participants: Able-bodied subjects (N10). Interventions: Subjects walked at 1.2m\/s on a treadmill and overground. Subjects manipulated vertical COM displacement either by adjusting stride length or by using visual feedback to reduce COM movement.  Main Outcome Measures: We measured kinematic and kinetic data to calculate vertical and lateral COM displace- ments, joint torques, and work. In addition, we collected oxy- gen consumption to calculated metabolic power.  Results: Increasing and decreasing vertical COM displace- ment beyond subjects’ preferred range resulted in increases in the metabolic cost of walking. When vertical COM displace- ment was reduced, corresponding increases in positive ankle and hip work and negative knee work were observed.  Conclusions: Humans are capable of walking in a manner that will reduce COM displacement from normal. Decreasing vertical COM movement results in increases in metabolic en- ergy costs because of greater mechanical work performed at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Thus, reducing vertical COM movement is not a successful strategy for improving either metabolic or mechanical energy economy during normal walk- ing by able-bodied subjects.","id":"dbf013c0-0eb4-46b3-9f71-1f84e0e5f252"}

The device is comprised of a high-pressure air tank, a pilot-operated valve, and a nozzle, which are employed together to create a thrust intended to correct a state of imbalance. The authors first employed modeling and simulation of the thruster-based system to assess feasibility of such a device, and based on these results designed and constructed a device prototype. The prototype was then tested on a rocking block that was used as an experimental model of a standing human subject. Experiments were conducted to assess the angular response of the rocking block starting from various initial tilt angles, both with and without the use of the cold gas thruster. For the experiments with the thruster, the valve was energized at the moment of release, thereby activating the cold-gas thruster, the thrust of which was directed to oppose the “fall.” A comparison between the two cases indicates that the fall prevention prototype increased the region of block stability by more than a factor of three (from a tilt angle of approximately 7 to 26 deg). I. INTRODUCTION Falls in elderly people are a well-known cause of injury. One in four people over the age of 65 fall every year costing an estimated $31.3 billion to Medicare annually [1]. As people age, their balance declines due to several physiological changes. In particular, balance depends on visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and musculoskeletal systems, all of which are subject to become compromised as age advances [2]. Falls can lead to severe injuries, fear of falling, loss of independence and death [3]. The majority of fall prevention research has focused on in-home strategies for preventing falls, such as handrails, higher friction flooring, and improved lighting. However, an epidemiological study of falls in older community-dwellings showed that 62% of falls occur while outside of the home [4]. A significant unmet need exists for a device to prevent falls outside of the home without a large impact on the user’s lifestyle. The recent emergence of wearable devices may offer promise to aid fall prevention.

Robotic technology has developed rapidly in recent years, and several robot-assisted gait devices were developed to enhance gait function and activities of daily living in elderly adults and patients with gait disorders. In this study, we investigated the effects of the Gait-enhancing Mechatronic System (GEMS), a new wearable robotic hip-assist device developed by Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd., Korea, on gait performance and foot pressure distribution in elderly adults. Methods: Thirty elderly adults who had no neurological or musculoskeletal abnormalities affecting gait participated in this study. A three-dimensional (3D) motion capture system, surface electromyography and the F-Scan system were used to collect data on spatiotemporal gait parameters, muscle activity and foot pressure distribution under three conditions: free gait without robot assistance (FG), robot-assisted gait with zero torque (RAG-Z) and robot- assisted gait (RAG). Results: We found increased gait speed, cadence, stride length and single support time in the RAG condition. Reduced rectus femoris and medial gastrocnemius muscle activity throughout the terminal stance phase and reduced effort of the medial gastrocnemius muscle throughout the pre-swing phase were also observed in the RAG condition. In addition, walking with the assistance of GEMS resulted in a significant increase in foot pressure distribution, specifically in maximum force and peak pressure of the total foot, medial masks, anterior masks and posterior masks. Conclusion: The results of the present study reveal that GEMS may present an alternative way of restoring age- related changes in gait such as gait instability with muscle weakness, reduced step force and lower foot pressure in elderly adults. In addition, GEMS improved gait performance by improving push-off power and walking speed and reducing muscle activity in the lower extremities.  Trial registration: NCT02843828.

To evaluate the system, three studies were performed. The method was ﬁrst tested on 10 healthy young volunteer subjects in a gait laboratory where an ultrasonic motion system was used as a reference system. In the second study, the system was tested onthree hospitalized elderlypeopleto classifywalking upstairs fromwalkingdownstairs andﬂat walking.Inthe third study, monitoring was performed on seven patients with peripheral vascular disease for 60 min during their daily physical activity. The ﬁrst study revealed a close relationship between the ambulatory andthe reference systems.Compared to the reference system, the ambulatory system hadan overall sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 98% and 97%, respectively. In the second study, the ambulatory system also showed a very high sensitivity (>94%) in identifying a 50 stairs ascent from walking on the ﬂat and walking downstairs. Finally, compared with visual surveillance, we observed a relatively high accuracy in identifying 196 walking upstairs cycles through daily physical activity in the third study.

We evaluated the performance of XGBoost across different stair heights and inclination angles and found that it generalizes well across preset conditions.

ACCEPTED JANUARY 2022 1 Abstract—Ankle exoskeletons have the potential to improve mobility, but common controllers are often inflexible to variations in tasks, such as changes in walking speed. To enable effective variable-speed exoboot control, we developed and validated a two-headed convolutional neural network trained to (1) classify stance versus swing and (2) predict the phase during stance, which was then mapped to a desired exoboot torque. This Machine Learning Estimator (MLE) was trained from nine participants walking at three speeds and four exoboot assistance levels. A Time-Based Estimator (TBE) that predicted gait phase from the two previous stride durations was used to apply realistic torques during MLE training and served as a within–participant control condition. The MLE was validated online with three new participants walking at a range of speeds and torques, both interpolating within and extrapolating outside the training set. Online validation accuracy (RMSE) across tested speeds and torque levels was 3.9%. On a simple walking task in which treadmill speed was varied sinusoidally between 1.1 and 1.6 m\/s with a 30 s period, the three participants exhibited a mean 5.2% decrease in metabolic expenditure with the MLE compared to no-exo (boots only), but exhibited a 5.4% increase when walking with the TBE. The MLE more accurately predicted heel strike and toe off events (heel strike Mean Absolute Error: 9.6 ms; toe off MAE: 13.2 ms) than the TBE (heel strike MAE: 19.1 ms; toe off MAE: 34 ms). These positive results validated the potential of using a deep learning model for gait state estimation to effectively control an ankle exoskeleton across variable walking speeds.

The use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) in joint moment estimation has drawn considerable attention. Minimizing the number of IMUs deployed on the lower-limb and simplifying the application procedure have long been the pressing problem to be solved during the accurate estimation of multiple joint moments in multiple scenarios. In the present study, the performance of seven different deep-learning models, including the proposed attention-based conventional neural network- bidirectional long short-term memory model and six previous-published typical deep-learning models, were compared in predicting the sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle joint moments during the most representative locomotive activities. A public dataset was employed to train and validate these models. Seven configurations of IMUs, including different placement and number of IMUs, were evaluated to explore the influence of IMU setup on the performance of the proposed model. Of all seven deep-learning models, best performance was achieved using the proposed model. Pearson correlation coefficient derived from the proposed model using a single IMU attached on the shank, foot, and thigh reached up to 0.85, 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. Shank is the optimal location for attaching a single IMU for the moment prediction of all three joints, while extra IMUs attached elsewhere failed to derive pronounced benefit for improving the estimation accuracy. Thus, even using a single shank-worn IMU, the proposed model is still capable of accurately estimating the joint moments of lower-limbs.  1. Introduction","id":"7a59cb75-71bb-4049-9107-e5fec6c90ef5"}

The prosthesis and controller enable users to perform both step-over and step-to stair ascent and descent. The efficacy of the controller and SCSA prosthesis prototype in providing improved stair ambulation was tested on a unilateral transfemoral amputee in experiments that employed motion capture apparatus to compare joint kinematics with the SCSA prosthesis, relative to performing the same activity with a microprocessor-controlled daily-use passive prosthesis. Results suggest that the SCSA knee significantly decreases compensatory motion during stair activity when compared to the passive prosthesis. I. INTRODUCTION Many tasks of daily living are often more difficult for persons with transfemoral amputation than for their age-matched non-amputee counterparts [1, 2]. One task frequently performed either in the home or in daily life which has been shown to be exceptionally difficult for persons with amputation is traversing stairs [3]. Perhaps the most common type of knee prosthesis which provides stair ambulation capability is a microprocessor-controlled knee (MPK). MPKs incorporate stance control via modulated dampers that dissipate energy and thus provide controlled stance-knee yielding during stair descent. Such devices are capable of providing good step-to or step-over stair descent functionality. Although MPKs can provide adequate stair descent functionality, they are more limited in their ability to provide stair ascent functionality, due to two essential limitations: lack of active knee extension during stance phase, and lack of swing control during swing phase. The first assists during the stance phase of stair ascent in which the body center-of-mass is lifted, while the second guides the swing foot over the subsequent stair riser and onto the tread during the swing phase. The first of these limitations is less fundamental than the second. Specifically, in stance phase, an amputee can provide stance knee extension via hip extension. In swing phase, however, an amputee cannot directly provide a desired knee motion via hip effort. Specifically, a passive transfemoral prosthesis (e.g., an MPK) can be thought of as a double link pendulum with an actuated revolute joint at the hip and unactuated revolute joint at the knee. As shown in Fig.1, when in stance phase, the foot of the prosthesis is grounded, and as such the leg is fully controllable by the hip (i.e","id":"b5faa9e5-161c-43c7-923c-8ffbdb0cfa57"}

We investigated whether motion assistance from HAL during squat exercise could effectively reduce the cardiopulmonary burden in healthy subjects. Twelve healthy subjects (33 ± 11 years) performed squat exercise for 3 consecutive minutes at a repetition rate of 20 squats per minute with and without assistance from a lumbar-type HAL. The oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), and the Borg Scale were monitored during exercise. VO2 (930 ± 207 vs 992 ± 169 mL\/min, p < 0.05) and the Borg Scale rating (12.8 ± 1.1 vs 13.7 ± 0.8, p < 0.05) at the end of exercise were signiﬁcantly lower when HAL was used. When 2 subjects who regularly perform high-intensity exercise for more than 10 h per week were excluded from the analyses, VO2, VCO2, VE, and the Borg Scale were signiﬁcantly lower when HAL was used. Our results demonstrate that the lumbar-type HAL signiﬁcantly reduces cardiopulmonary burden during squat exercise in healthy subjects. The effects were especially striking in sedentary sub- jects.

BLS has attracted increasing attention from many scholars owing to its excellent performance. This article proposes a weighted BLS (WBLS) based on BLS to tackle the noise and outliers in an industrial process. WBLS provides a uniﬁed framework for easily using different methods of calculating the weighted penalty factor. Using the weighted penalty factor to constrain the contribution of each sample to modeling, the normal and abnormal samples were allocated higher and lower weights to increase and decrease their contributions, respectively. Hence, the WBLS can eliminate the bad effect of noise and outliers  on the modeling. The weighted ridge regression algorithm is used to compute the algorithm solution. Weighted incremental learning algorithms are also developed using the weighted penalty factor to tackle the noise and outliers in the additional samples and quickly increase nodes or samples without retraining. The proposed weighted incremental learning algorithms provide a uniﬁed framework for using different methods of computing weights. We test the feasibility of the proposed algorithms on some public data sets and a real-world application. Experiment results show that our method has better generalization and robustness.","id":"11d16328-a924-4a75-8d1c-7dff2ea56541"}

The system consists of two modules, each assisting a different aspect of gait: a tethered cable pelvic module with up to 6 degrees of freedom (DOF), which can modulate the motion of the pelvis in three dimensions, and a two DOF wearable hip module assisting lower limb motion, specifically hip flexion. Both modules are designed to be lightweight and minimally restrictive to the user, and the modules can operate independently or in cooperation with each other, allowing flexible system configuration to provide highly customized and adaptable assistance. Motion tracking performance of approximately 2 mm root mean square (RMS) error for the pelvic module and less than 0.1 mm RMS error for the hip module was achieved. We demonstrate coordinated operation of the two modules on a mannequin test platform with articulated and instrumented lower limbs. I. INTRODUCTION Developmental delay due to premature birth is a major public health problem in the United States [1]. One and a half percent of the more than 4.25 million infants born annually in the U.S. have a very low birth weight [2], and of the 90% that survive, 25-50% suffer a brain injury resulting in development of locomotor delays [3]–[5]. Cerebral palsy (CP) is one manifestation of these locomotor delays and the most common childhood disability that causes lifelong physical impairment, affecting an average of 3.1 per 1000 children in the US [6]. As fundamental motor skills are typically acquired in the early stages of development [7], early intervention is critical, and may help prevent or mitigate development of abnormal movement patterns that lead to secondary musculoskeletal *This research is supported by NSF grant 1329363, by the Harvard John A.

However, exoskeleton robots are not as popular as other service robots, such as communication robots and mobility robots. This is primarily because exoskeleton robots are in close contact with the human body, making safety and operability an issue. Reduction gears that show a high reduction ratio and high backdrivability have been proposed to solve these problems. Reduction gears with a high backdrivability can be used to esti- mate external force without using any additional devices, such as torque sensors. Therefore, this study introduces the development of an knee exoskeleton using a highly back-drivable gear. The size of a developed knee exoskeleton is approximately 220 W60 D65 H mm with a weight of approximately 1.2 kg. Moreover, we introduce an external force estimation method without a torque sensor. We used a multi encoder based disturbance observer (MEDOB) to estimate the external force. The experimental results of the external force estimation are presented. The root mean square error of the external force estimation without and with input assist torque were 0.162 and 0.128 Nm, respectively. We conﬁrm that estimating external torque with high accuracy is possible with and without assisted control.  .  .  .

The wearable device, to be worn invisibly underneath clothes, not only ﬁts tightly to the wearer’s lower body, but also comfortably transmits assistive torque to the wearer’s hip\/knee joint. To overcome deﬁciencies in the usability of conventional wearable walking assistance devices, two novel features are proposed: 1) a unique ﬂexible support frame that withstands vertical loads while maintaining the natural curvature of the wearer’s lower body; and 2) a kinematically similar anthropomorphic joint that minimizes the unintended resistance force during the wearer’s usual motions. The developed wearable walking assistance de- vice based on these features was veriﬁed by simulations and experiments whose results are described.

Analysis of the Bayesian Gait-State Estimation Problem for Lower-Limb Wearable Robot Sensor Configurations  Roberto Leo Medrano1, Gray Cortright Thomas2, Elliott J. Rouse1, Robert D. Gregg2 1Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Robotics Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA  2Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Robotics Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA  Abstract  Many exoskeletons today are primarily tested in controlled, steady-state laboratory conditions that are unrealistic representations of their real-world usage in which walking conditions (e.g., speed, slope, and stride length) change constantly. One potential solution is to detect these changing walking conditions online using Bayesian state estimation to deliver assistance that continuously adapts to the wearer’s gait. This paper investigates such an approach in silico, aiming to understand 1) which of the various Bayesian filter assumptions best match the problem, and 2) which gait parameters can be feasibly estimated with different combinations of sensors available to different exoskeleton configurations (pelvis, thigh, shank, and\/or foot). Our results suggest that the assumptions of the Extended Kalman Filter are well suited to accurately estimate phase, stride frequency, stride length, and ramp inclination with a wide variety of sparse sensor configurations.

Compared with the muscle, the ankle joint produced relatively similar moments across the walking tasks and participants. Changes in ankle power were more similar to the estimated muscle response across walking speeds (Fig. 3A, figs. S2 and S3, table S2). This is likely reflective of increased angular velocity and may suggest that the force generated during concentric contraction of the muscle is primarily directed at increasing joint velocity when modulating walking speed. However, ankle power did not follow the same trend as the muscle for incline walking. The largest disparity between the joint (+13% increase in peak ankle moment and +19% in peak ankle power compared with level) and the estimated muscle force (+92%) happens in incline walking. This is expected as the muscle must produce more work to add energy to the center of mass to overcome gravity, rather than relying upon passive energy storage and return. These data suggest that there may be different neuromuscular strategies that individuals develop depending on tasks and on variability in physiologic features such as tendon stiffness (68, 69), that in the end result in more similar response to the external environment at the joint level.  Our data found no correlation between peak MBA exosuit torque (non-mass normalized) and body mass in contrast to the established positive correlation between peak ankle moment (non- mass normalized) and body mass (70). Because of this relationship between ankle moment and body mass, assistance profiles are often scaled to the participant body mass (15, 20, 37, 40, 50). However, our data suggest that individual underlying physiology can be complicated and nonintuitive, and that assistance strategies should consider the underlying physiology and task- specific demands at the muscle level.","id":"ecea4ff8-879a-426d-9bb4-f441f9e5fc53"}

First published Feb- ruary 24, 2016; doi:10.1152\/jn.00941.2015.—Movements can be learned implicitly in response to new environmental demands or explicitly through instruction and strategy. The former is often studied in an environment that perturbs movement so that people learn to correct the errors and store a new motor pattern. Here, we demonstrate in human walking that implicit learning of foot placement occurs even when an explicit strategy is used to block changes in foot placement during the learning process. We studied people learning a new walking pattern on a split-belt treadmill with and without an explicit strategy through instruction on where to step. When there is no instruction, subjects implicitly learn to place one foot in front of the other to minimize step-length asymmetry during split-belt walking, and the learned pattern is maintained when the belts are returned to the same speed, i.e., postlearning. When instruction is provided, we block expression of the new foot-placement pattern that would otherwise naturally develop from adaptation. Despite this appearance of no learning in foot placement, subjects show similar postlearning effects as those who were not given any instruction. Thus locomotor adap- tation is not dependent on a change in action during learning but instead can be driven entirely by an unexpressed internal recalibration of the desired movement.  adaptation; feedback; gait; motor learning; walking","id":"c523e5e1-9674-4b0e-bf47-7cb6ded595c2"}

Abstract Objective: To investigate the effects of an automated stride assistance device that assists hip joint ﬂexion and extension movement in energy expenditure during walking in healthy young adults using an expired gas method. Design: Prospective, single-group design to compare the differences of energy expenditure between 2 assistive conditions. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Healthy volunteers (NZ10) aged 21 to 32 years. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Oxygen consumption per unit time ( _VO2) cost (ml$kg1$m1), and heart rate (beats\/min) were measured in 2 assistive conditions (with 3-Nm hip motion assistance and without assistance) and at 2 walking speeds (comfortable walking speed [CWS] and maximum walking speed [MWS]). Results: There were no signiﬁcant differences in walking speed between the with- and without-assistance conditions at either the CWS or MWS. The _VO2 cost and heart rate were signiﬁcantly reduced in the with-assistance condition compared with the without-assistance condition, at both the CWS and MWS. The reduction in the _VO2 cost during the with-assistance condition, relative to the without-assistance condition, was 7.06% at the CWS and 10.52% at the MWS. Conclusions: The automated stride assistance device is useful for reducing energy expenditure during walking in healthy adults. Further studies are warranted to investigate if this device provides substantial help to individuals with impaired mobility as a result of strength deﬁcits.

When we’re young, we often role-play and pretend we have superpowers. Inspired by these experiences, we started working on what we refer to as superhuman sports, focusing on how we might make some of these powers a reality.  We want to create an application area to explore human augmenta- tion and enhance human abilities in a playful way. The field of superhu- man sports combines competition and physical elements from traditional sports with technology to overcome the somatic and spatial limitations of our human bodies. The field serves as a fascinating application area for human augmentation.  Toward SuPErhuman SPorTS Science—in particular, information technology—is already an integral part of today’s sports training and events. However, traditional sports emphasize the achievements of the individual. Sport federations and competitions struggle when it comes to knowing how to deal with the augmented human concept.  Consider, for example, Markus Rehm, an amputated long jumper with a  prosthetic right leg. He uses a blade-type leg prosthesis when competing. In 2014, he qualified for the European Champi- onships but wasn’t allowed to compete,1 because his prosthesis was viewed as a violation of the rules, even though it hasn’t been proven that the prosthesis gives him a natural advantage; other athletes with similar prostheses didn’t perform so well.2 This illustrates the current direction and challenges of allowing augmented humans to partici- pate in conventional sports.  In contrast, superhuman sports aim to create a field where people compete, overcoming technological—rather than solely human—limitations. The focus is on improving cognitive and physical functions of the human body, creating artificial senses and reflexes to partici- pate in sports competitions. We want to create and explore new experiences with these novel senses and reflexes by augmenting old sports and designing new ones, enhancing sports training, and sharing the experiences with both local and remote audience members.","id":"6b0e90c4-7728-4da2-ad11-8e5727e845a7"}

Nguyen1, Rachel W. Jackson2, Yashar Aucie3, Digna de Kam3, Steven H. Collins1 and Gelsy Torres-Oviedo3*  Abstract  Background: Asymmetric gait post-stroke is associated with decreased mobility, yet individuals with chronic stroke often self-select an asymmetric gait despite being capable of walking more symmetrically. The purpose of this study was to test whether self-selected asymmetry could be explained by energy cost minimization. We hypothesized that short-term deviations from self-selected asymmetry would result in increased metabolic energy consumption, despite being associated with long-term rehabilitation benefits. Other studies have found no difference in metabolic rate across different levels of enforced asymmetry among individuals with chronic stroke, but used methods that left some uncertainty to be resolved.  Methods: In this study, ten individuals with chronic stroke walked on a treadmill at participant-specific speeds while voluntarily altering step length asymmetry. We included only participants with clinically relevant self-selected asymmetry who were able to significantly alter asymmetry using visual biofeedback. Conditions included targeting zero asymmetry, self-selected asymmetry, and double the self-selected asymmetry. Participants were trained with the biofeedback system in one session, and data were collected in three subsequent sessions with repeated measures. Self-selected asymmetry was consistent across sessions. A similar protocol was conducted among unimpaired participants. Results: Participants with chronic stroke substantially altered step length asymmetry using biofeedback, but this did not affect metabolic rate (ANOVA, p = 0.68). In unimpaired participants, self-selected step length asymmetry was close to zero and corresponded to the lowest metabolic energy cost (ANOVA, p = 6e-4). While the symmetry of unimpaired gait may be the result of energy cost minimization, self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke cannot be explained by a similar least-effort drive.  Conclusions: Interventions that encourage changes in step length asymmetry by manipulating metabolic energy consumption may be effective because these therapies would not have to overcome a metabolic penalty for altering asymmetry.","id":"8736cf6b-b599-4ab7-8618-f7bb3def1f90"}

This paper addresses the challenge of planar dynamic robotic walking over stochastically generated stepping stones with significant variations in step length and step height, and where the robot has knowledge about the location of the next discrete foothold only one step ahead. Specifically, our approach utilizes a two-step periodic gait optimization technique to build a library of gaits parametrized by their resulting step lengths and step heights, as well as the initial configuration of the robot. By doing so, we address the problems involved during step transition when switching between the different walking gaits. We then use gait interpo- lation in real-time to obtain the desired gait. The proposed method is successfully validated on ATRIAS, an underactuated, human-scale bipedal robot, to achieve precise footstep placement. With no change in step height, step lengths are varied in the range of [23:78] cm. When both step length and step height are changed, their variation are within [30:65] cm and [222:22] cm, respectively. The average walking speed of both these experiments is 0.6 m\/s.  Keywords Bipedal robot, stepping stones, gait library  1. Introduction  A primary advantage of legged robotic systems over their wheeled counterparts is their ability to navigate over rugged terrain such as over discrete footholds or ‘‘stepping stones.’’ Unlike prior work that rely on simplistic robot models (such as pendulum models) and fully actuated control schemes (e.g. zero moment point (ZMP)) to achieve the desired foot placements, in this work, we propose a formal framework that achieves planar dynamic underactuated walking over a randomly varying discrete terrain with significant simulta- neous changes in step length and step height at each step.","id":"318518c7-a215-4196-ad5e-858460bf1db1"}

This physical system illustrates another simple model, the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP); a popular template for legged robot control and, in this letter, the mapping channel between the operator and robot. We develop a scaling strategy based on geometric and kinematic similarity in order to generate dynamically feasible trajectories for the LIP with a natural frequency different than the human’s.

Based on the human-robot interaction force information, a PID control algorithm is applied to realize the passive following control of the swing phase. Aiming at the requirements of the active assist of the support phase on the joint angle and the size of the assist, a composite control method with PID control as the outer loop and sliding mode control as the inner loop is proposed. In order to solve the sliding mode vibration problem, the equivalent sliding mode control algorithm is used, and the sign function in it is replaced by the saturation function. On this basis, the experimental system was built and the experimental study was completed, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption during the human weight-bearing staircase.

Accu- rate force\/torque sensing is necessary to measure the physical interaction between the user, the prosthesis, and the environment. Most available solutions consist of retroﬁtting an off-the-shelf load cell, which leads to suboptimal designs regarding weight and size, ultimately reducing the prosthesis usability. To address this limitation, we propose to instrument an existing prosthesis component, namely, a pyramid adapter, with force\/torque sensing and an inertial measurement unit. Magnetic sensing of large structural deformations is used to improve system reliability and reduce costs. Testing shows that the proposed sensor prototype can sense up to 120 Nm and 2500 N of torque and force and has 2.1% and 8.3% nonlinearity, respectively, during walking. The total weight is 150 g—only 66 g more than a standard pyramid adapter without force\/torque instrumentation. Amputee testing with robotic leg prosthesis is conducted to validate the instrumented pyramid in a case scenario.  the physical interaction between the user, the prosthesis, and the environment.  The development of force\/torque sensors for prosthetic applications requires satisfying competing design requirements in terms of a wide force and torque range and a small, lightweight package. During common ambulation activities, torque and force at the ankle, normalized by the user’s body weight, peak at about 1.7 Nm\/kg and 11.4 N\/kg [10], respectively. This relatively wide range of torque and force is easier to satisfy if the sensor dimensions and weight are not critical. However, in prosthetic applications, the size of the force\/torque sensor affects the overall prosthesis dimensions, especially the build height, which ultimately determines how many people can use the prosthesis [11]. Moreover, increasing the prosthesis weight affects gait negatively by increasing metabolic consumption and muscle effort [12], [13]. As a result, it is important to minimize build height and weight in sensors used for prosthetic applications.  Index Terms—Ambulation, force\/torque sensing, prosthetics.  I.

We recapitulate a control framework for Lagrangian hybrid systems, and show that regulat- ing a state varying energy function is equivalent to applying energy shaping and regulat- ing the system to a constant energy value. We then consider a simple one-dimensional hopping robot and show how energy shaping and regulation control can be used to gen- erate and transition between nearly globally stable hopping limit cycles. The principles from this example are then applied on two canonical walking models, the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) and compass gait biped, to generate and transition between locomotive gaits.

A person with a healthy knee can able to walk freely without any pain in the knee joint but factors like ageing, osteoarthritis can damage the meniscus, articular cartilage and can cause increased compression between the bone which results in knee pain. This compression between the bones can be reduced by extending the knee joint which can provide pain relief. In this proposed method, an exoskeleton knee extension system for transferring the whole-body weight to shoe and an actuating mechanism is designed to extend the knee joint. NodeMCU ESP8266 controller is used to receive feedback from the load cell to drive the motor which provides extension. Only a prototype of is proposed. The necessary extension device extension has been achieved with this prototype and it lifted up to 17 kg. The placements of cuff in the thigh and shank region provided proper grip such that the upper body weight is transferred to the shoe. This is a prototype model and it can be further developed into a clinical device and the extension in the knee joint can be tested by proper clinical trials in future.

Collins and Rachel W. Jackson Department of Mechanical Engineering, Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213-3815 biomechatronics.cit.cmu.edu, stevecollins@cmu.edu  Abstract—Stroke leads to severe mobility impairments for millions of individuals each year. Functional outcomes can be improved through manual treadmill therapy, but high costs limit patient exposure and, thereby, outcomes. Robotic gait training could increase the viable duration and frequency of training sessions, but robotic approaches employed thus far have been less effective than manual therapy. These shortcomings may relate to subconscious energy-minimizing drives, which might cause patients to engage less actively in therapy when provided with corrective robotic assistance. We have devised a new method for gait rehabilitation that harnesses, rather than ﬁghts, least-effort tendencies. Therapeutic goals, such as increased use of the paretic limb, are made easier than the patient’s nominal gait through selective assistance from a robotic platform. We performed a pilot test on a healthy subject (N = 1) in which altered self-selected stride length was induced using a tethered robotic ankle-foot orthosis. The subject ﬁrst walked on a treadmill while wearing the orthosis with and without assistance at unaltered and voluntarily altered stride length. Voluntarily increasing stride length by 5% increased metabolic energy cost by 4%. Robotic assistance decreased energy cost at both unaltered and voluntarily increased stride lengths, by 6% and 8% respectively. We then performed a test in which the robotic system continually monitored stride the subject’s stride length and provided more assistance if length approached a target increase. This adaptive assistance protocol caused the subject to slowly adjust their gait patterns towards the target, leading to a 4% increase in stride length. Metabolic energy consumption was simultaneously reduced by 5%. These results suggest that selective-assistance protocols based on targets relevant to rehabilitation might lead patients to self- select desirable gait patterns during robotic gait training sessions, possibly facilitating better adherence and outcomes.

Young, Anirban Mazumdar  Abstract—New human-centric approaches to safety can combine over-head camera views with situational awareness tools to enable humans to avoid rapidly evolving threats such as moving machines or falling debris. This paper explores how 360⁰ information can be used to inform humans of potential collisions. Specifically, we quantify how different individual (tactile, audio, and visual) and combined cue modalities affect failure rates and reaction times. Human-subject experiments were conducted in a custom virtual reality environment that simulates objects rapidly moving toward the subject. In order to successfully perform their task, the human subject must physically move their body out of the path of the moving threat before a collision occurs. This exploration of full-body physical response differentiates from previous related studies. The results of the 18-subject study provide quantified data on a range of cues and cue combinations. The study quantified failure rates and reaction times as a function of index of difficulty (Fitt’s Law) and threat directionality. The results confirm the hypothesis that the addition of tactile cues improve performance compared to non-tactile statistically cues with regards to failure rate and reaction time. This demonstrates how sensory cues can improve human physical response to rapid threats.  this work  Index Terms—tactile feedback, situational awareness, virtual  reality, sensory augmentation, human-machine communication.

Panizzolo1,2, Ignacio Galiana1,2, Alan T. Asbeck1,2, Christopher Siviy1,2, Kai Schmidt1,2, Kenneth G. Holt3 and Conor J. Walsh1,2*  Abstract  Background: Carrying load alters normal walking, imposes additional stress to the musculoskeletal system, and results in an increase in energy consumption and a consequent earlier onset of fatigue. This phenomenon is largely due to increased work requirements in lower extremity joints, in turn requiring higher muscle activation. The aim of this work was to assess the biomechanical and physiological effects of a multi-joint soft exosuit that applies assistive torques to the biological hip and ankle joints during loaded walking. Methods: The exosuit was evaluated under three conditions: powered (EXO_ON), unpowered (EXO_OFF) and unpowered removing the equivalent mass of the device (EXO_OFF_EMR). Seven participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill and carried a load equivalent to 30 % their body mass. We assessed their metabolic cost of walking, kinetics, kinematics, and lower limb muscle activation using a portable gas analysis system, motion capture system, and surface electromyography.  Results: Our results showed that the exosuit could deliver controlled forces to a wearer. Net metabolic power in the EXO_ON condition (7.5 ± 0.6 W kg−1) was 7.3 ± 5.0 % and 14.2 ± 6.1 % lower than in the EXO_OFF_EMR condition (7.9 ± 0.8 W kg−1; p = 0.027) and in the EXO_OFF condition (8.5 ± 0.9 W kg−1; p = 0.005), respectively. The exosuit also reduced the total joint positive biological work (sum of hip, knee and ankle) when comparing the EXO_ON condition (1.06 ± 0.16 J kg−1) with respect to the EXO_OFF condition (1.28 ± 0.26 J kg−1; p = 0.020) and to the EXO_OFF_EMR condition (1.22 ± 0.21 J kg−1; p = 0.007). Conclusions: The results of the present work demonstrate for the first time that a soft wearable robot can improve walking economy. These findings pave the way for future assistive devices that may enhance or restore gait in other applications.

Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Positive biomechanical outcomes have been re- ported with lower-limb exoskeletons in laboratory settings, but these devices have difﬁculty delivering appropriate assistance in synchronywith human gait as the task or rate of phase progression change in real-world environments. This paper presents a torque controller for an ankle exoskeleton that uses state estimation with a data-driven kinematic model to continuously estimate the phase, phase rate, stride length, and ramp parameters during locomotion. The controller applies torque assistance based on the estimated phase and adapts the torque proﬁle based on the estimated task variables to match human torques observed in a multi-activity database of 10 able-bodied subjects. We demonstrate in silico that the controller yields phase estimates that are more accurate than state of the art, while also estimating task variables with compa- rable accuracy to recent machine learning approaches. The con- troller implemented in an ankle exoskeleton successfully adapts its assistance in response to changing phase and task variables, both during controlled treadmill trials (6 able-bodied subjects) and a real-world stress test with extremely uneven terrain.

Panizzolo, Conor Walsh, Member, IEEE  Abstract—In this paper we describe an IMU-based iterative controller for hip extension assistance where the onset timing of assistance is based on an estimate of the maximum hip flexion angle. The controller was implemented on a mono-articular soft exosuit coupled to a lab-based multi-joint actuation platform that enables rapid reconfiguration of different sensors and control strategy implementation. The controller design is motivated by a model of the suit-human interface and utilizes an iterative control methodology that includes gait detection and step-by-step actuator position profile generation to control the onset timing, peak timing, and peak magnitude of the delivered force. This controller was evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.5 m\/s while carrying a load of 23 kg. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across subjects. Specifically, for a given profile, the average delivered force started concurrently with the timing of the maximum hip flexion angle and reached its peak timing 22.7 ± 0.63% later in the gait cycle (desired 23%) with a peak magnitude of 198.2 ± 1.6 N (desired 200 N), equivalent to an average peak torque of 30.5 ± 4.7 Nm. This control approach was used to assess the metabolic effect of four different assistive profiles. Metabolic reductions ranging from 5.7% to 8.5% were found when comparing the powered conditions with the unpowered condition. This work enables studies to assess the biomechanical and physiological responses to different assistive profiles to determine the optimal hip extension assistance during walking.  I.

Naturally, various forms of upper limb impairments can have a substantial impact on quality of life. We developed the Myoshirt, a textile-based soft wearable robot, or exomuscle, that autonomously follows the user’s movements and thereby assists the shoulder against gravity. With the Myoshirt, participants without impairments (n = 10, 5 male) experienced a delayed onset of muscular fatigue by 51.1 s (36.1%, P < 0.001), while during a functional task their muscular activity decreased by 49.1% (P < 0.001). Analogously, two participants with upper limb impairments due to a muscular dystrophy and a spinal cord injury experienced a delayed onset of muscular fatigue during unloaded arm lifts by 256.4 s (61.5%) and by 450.6 s (210.3%), respectively. Our evidence suggests that the Myoshirt is an effective tool that intuitively assists the shoulder during functional reaching tasks, with the potential of increasing the personal independence of people with upper limb impairments.  Being able to effortlessly perform activities of daily living is  essential to guarantee personal independence. Therefore, naturally, when the function of the arms is impaired due to a  congenital or acquired disorder, quality of life is challenged.  Conventionally, people with upper limb impairments are pro- vided with physio- and occupational therapy. During the training, therapists use different tools, such as weight support or strength trainers, to facilitate and amplify the impact of their work1. In the recent past, therapy robots have been introduced to comple- ment conventional therapy tools1–3. Among these, therapy robots for arm and hand function often come in the form of large, sta- tionary devices1,4–6. They serve as training tools for people with more severe impairments1.

First, we designed the generative adversar- ial network-based graph transformer (GANGT) for applica- tion under small sample surface electromyography (sEMG) dataset conditions. The adversarial learning is utilized to generate featured sEMG data, and graph structure-based temporal and spatial self-attention mechanisms are con- structed to capture the local and global features of the sEMG signal during a gait cycle. Second, we designed a robust following controller to control the tracking error of the predicted joint angles and proved its stability through the Lyapunov function. The controller is able to maintain the tracking error within a small bound in the case of un- modeled errors and external disturbances in the dynamical system of the exoskeleton. To validate the effectiveness of the control framework, we conducted a series of ex- periments with recruited subjects.

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller. The data indicates that the exoskeleton with controller provided the intended extent of movement coordination, while still allowing the subject to maintain walking balance.

INTRODUCTION Stroke has an annual incidence of approximately 795,000 people in the United States, of which approximately 665,000 survive [1]. Of these, approximately 200,000 annually are affected by lower-extremity hemiparesis to an extent that prevents walking without assistance six months after the stroke (i.e., by the time they enter the chronic stages of stroke) [2]–[4]. The inability to walk unassisted has an obvious impact on an individual’s independence and community dwelling capability, and thus quality of life and continued health. Post-stroke gait impairment is comprised of a number of factors, including muscle weakness, spasticity, and impaired coordination. During the stance phase of the gait cycle, the paretic side is characterized by a shorter stance time due to impaired hip and knee flexion and extension.

Different fixed assistance profiles for walking and running were applied based on an online classification algorithm. The approach is based on the biomechanical understanding that the center of mass potential energy fluctuations during walking and running are out of phase. Specifically, we monitor the vertical acceleration with an abdomen-mounted IMU at the moment of maximum hip extension. Validation is demonstrated with six subjects on the treadmill and with eight subjects outdoors. Our results demonstrated a 99.99% accuracy on average over the fourteen participants for various speeds (0.5 – 4m\/s), slopes (-10 – 20%), treadmill and overground terrain, loaded (13.6 kg) and unloaded, Exo On and Exo Off conditions, and different shoe types. Results from an evaluation outdoors overground on the energetics of eight subjects demonstrated a significant reduction for running when comparing Exo On to No Exo (3.9%) and for walking and running when comparing Exo On to Exo Off (12.2% and 8.2% respectively). This study represents the first demonstration of an autonomous wearable robot reducing the energy cost of running. Significant variation in response across subjects was observed, highlighting further improvements may be possible via assistance profile individualization with human-in-the-loop optimization. I. INTRODUCTION Lower limb wearable exoskeletons have been developed for a wide range of applications, including assisting or augmenting human locomotion and rehabilitation [1-11]. In the field of human performance augmentation in particular, the past decade has seen remarkable breakthroughs in exoskeletons that are able to reduce the metabolic expenditure of walking [3-11]. Initially, tethered devices were the first to achieve a net metabolic reduction during walking. Sawicki et al. used artificial pneumatic muscles at ankle joints and showed a statistically significant reduction beyond the level of walking without exoskeleton at 1.75m\/s out of several speeds tested [3].

In this article, several deep variants of BLS are reviewed, and a new adaptive incremen- tal structure, Stacked BLS, is proposed. The proposed model is a novel incremental stacking of BLS. This invariant inherits the efﬁciency and effectiveness of BLS that the structure and weights of lower layers of BLS are ﬁxed when the new blocks are added. The incremental stacking algorithm computes not only the con- nection weights between the newly stacking blocks but also the connection weights of the enhancement nodes within the BLS block. The Stacked BLS is considered as the increment of “layers” and “neurons” dynamically during the training for multilayer neural networks. The proposed architecture along with the training algorithms that utilizes the residual characteristic is very versatile in comparison with traditional ﬁxed architecture. Finally, experimental results on UCI datasets, MNIST dataset, NORB dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, SVHN dataset, and CIFAR- 100 dataset indicate that the proposed method outperforms the selected state-of-the-art methods on both accuracy and training speed, such as deep residual networks. The results also imply that the proposed structure could highly reduce the number of nodes and the training time of the original BLS in the classiﬁcation task of some datasets.","id":"d8a5b0c0-874e-4c7c-bd95-b3f240c1e9f3"}

Young aaron.young@me.gatech.edu  A broad goal in the field of powered lower limb exoskeletons is to reduce the metabolic cost of walking. Ankle exoskeletons have successfully achieved this goal by correctly timing a plantarflexor torque during late stance phase. Hip exoskeletons have the poten- tial to assist with both flexion and extension during walking gait, but the optimal timing for maximally reducing metabolic cost is unknown. The focus of our study was to determine the best assistance timing for applying hip assistance through a pneumatic exoskeleton on human subjects. Ten non-impaired subjects walked with a powered hip exoskeleton, and both hip flexion and extension assistance were separately provided at different actuation timings using a simple burst controller. The largest average across-subject reduction in metabolic cost for hip extension was at 90% of the gait cycle (just prior to heel contact) and for hip flexion was at 50% of the gait cycle; this resulted in an 8.4 and 6.1% metabolic reduction, respectively, compared to walking with the unpowered exoskeleton. However, the ideal timing for both flexion and extension assistance varied across subjects. When selecting the assistance timing that maximally reduced metabolic cost for each subject, average metabolic cost for hip extension was 10.3% lower and hip flexion was 9.7% lower than the unpowered condition. When taking into account user preference, we found that subject preference did not correlate with metabolic cost. This indicated that user feedback was a poor method of determining the most metabolically efficient assistance power timing. The findings of this study are relevant to developers of exoskeletons that have a powered hip component to assist during human walking gait.","id":"2bc03a91-7ce8-418d-9848-59c5974e77dc"}

Myers1,4, Iraklis I. Pipinos4,5, Philippe Malcolm1*  The metabolic rate of walking can be reduced by applying a constant forward force at the center of mass. It has been shown that the metabolically optimal constant force magnitude minimizes propulsion ground reaction force at the expense of increased braking. This led to the hypothesis that selectively assisting propulsion could lead to greater benefits. We used a robotic waist tether to evaluate the effects of forward forces with different timings and magnitudes. Here, we show that it is possible to reduce the metabolic rate of healthy participants by 48% with a greater efficiency ratio of metabolic cost reduction per unit of net aiding work compared with other assistive robots. This result was obtained using a sinusoidal force profile with peak timing during the middle of the double support. The same timing could also reduce the metabolic rate in patients with peripheral artery disease. A model explains that the optimal force profile accelerates the center of mass into the inverted pendulum movement during single support. Contrary to the hypothesis, the optimal force timing did not entirely coincide with propulsion. Within the field of wearable robotics, there is a trend to use devices to mimic biological torque or force profiles. Such bioinspired actuation can have relevant benefits; however, our results demonstrate that this is not neces- sarily optimal for reducing metabolic rate.","id":"89e22ef5-2cc9-4d27-b93f-fc4457b8dc73"}

Villarreal, Student Member, IEEE, Hasan A. Poonawala, Member, IEEE and Robert D. Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—The phase of human gait is difﬁcult to quantify accurately in the presence of disturbances. In contrast, recent bipedal robots use time-independent controllers relying on a mechanical phase variable to synchronize joint patterns through the gait cycle. This concept has inspired studies to determine if human joint patterns can also be parameterized by a mechanical variable. Although many phase variable candidates have been proposed, it remains unclear which, if any, provide a robust representation of phase for human gait analysis or control. In this paper we analytically derive an ideal phase variable (the hip phase angle) that is provably monotonic and bounded throughout the gait cycle. To examine the robustness of this phase variable, ten able-bodied human subjects walked over a platform that randomly applied phase-shifting perturbations to the stance leg. A statistical analysis found the correlations between nominal and perturbed joint trajectories to be signiﬁcantly greater when parameterized by the hip phase angle (0.95+) than by time or a different phase variable. The hip phase angle also best parameterized the transient errors about the nominal periodic interlimb phasing was best explained by local orbit. Finally, (ipsilateral) hip phase angles that are synchronized during the double-support period.  Index Terms—Phase, human gait, perturbations, nonlinear  dynamics and control  I.

To enable effective variable-speed exoboot control, we developed and validated a two- headed convolutional neural network trained to (1) classify stance versus swing and (2) predict the phase during stance, which was then mapped to a desired exoboot torque. This Machine Learning Estimator (MLE) was trained from nine participants walking at three speeds and four exoboot assistancelevels.

Humans can generate diverse locomotion behaviors through the hierarchical control of the supraspinal and the spinal systems, where the spinal control is often assumed to consist of central pattern generators and reﬂexes. It has been demonstrated through simulation that human walking and running can be generated with control models where the central pattern generator is controlled in a hierarchical structure. How- ever, no reﬂex control model in such framework has been proposed. Here we propose that locomotion behaviors can be controlled by a hierarchical control structure where the supraspinal system modulates reﬂexes with simple signals. We demonstrate in physics simulation that a simple neu- romuscular model with a hierarchical reﬂex control can regulate running speed and height on unknown terrains with height diﬀerences of ±10cm.  1  Introduction  Humans exhibit agile locomotion behaviors such as altering the locomotion speed and jumping over obstacles as needed. It is widely recognized that such behaviors are realized through a hierarchical control structure consisting of the supraspinal and the spinal control layer [1]. Spinal locomotion of decerebrated cats [2] and other vertebrates [3,4] demonstrates that large part of the control of normal locomotion is conducted in the spinal cord. To intentionally control locomotion behaviors based on environmental cues, it is necessary to modulate the spinal control through the supraspinal system. Therefore, understanding the mecha- nism of the spinal control and how it interacts with the supraspinal control is essential for explaining how legged locomotion is governed in biological systems. Diﬀerent types of human neuromuscular control models have demonstrated stable bipedal locomotion in physics simulation [5–8]. In a previous study, we have shown with a 3D human neuromuscular model that a reﬂex-based spinal control can generate diverse locomotion behaviors, including walking and run- ning, slope and stair negotiation, and deliberate obstacle avoidance [8]. Each be- havior has been generated with diﬀerent set of spinal control parameters, leaving unexplained how the diﬀerent sets can be stored and selected by the supraspinal system. In this study, we explore a simple solution of building a lookup table by mapping, in prior, all relevant states and control parameter sets. To this end,","id":"a8b18d4c-f3d1-4f81-9a54-11215bea7696"}

Based on this passive dynamics of human locomotion, we develop an energy-efﬁcient braking torque controller for a robotic transtibial prosthesis. The con- troller ﬁrst generates motor current\/torque from human locomotion instead of the battery energy, and then controls the current\/torque with alternating current sensing and voltage-controlled-resistor. On the basis of the low-level motor torque controller, we then propose the impedance model that determines the desired joint torque according to the joint angle and joint velocity, the prosthesis model that converts the desired ankle joint torque to desired motor torque, and the friction model that estimates the friction torque and compensates the joint torque. Step response and frequency response show that the low-level controller can reach the desired torque value within 0.07 s, and has a −3 dB bandwidth of 25.2 Hz. Experiments of level-ground treadmill walking with three amputees show that the pros- thesis with the proposed controller can effectively mimic the normal ankle performance and bring the amputees a natural gait pattern with low power consumption.

Following stroke, altered gait biomechanics contribute to inefﬁcient walking. Aside from assisting the ankle, there is also potential in augmenting locomotion by actuating the hip. We describe a proof-of-concept wearable, soft, hip exosuit, that assists with paretic hip ﬂexion during late stance and swing phases. The exosuit allows for adjustment of force and timing parameters. Parameter tuning was guided by a physical therapist based on their observations during study sessions. In a sample of survivors of stroke, we demonstrated that the hip exosuit was able to deliver low, comfortable levels of hip ﬂexion assistive forces. When powered, the exosuit effectively increased thigh angle and angular velocity during paretic swing phase compared to unpowered con- dition. These preliminary ﬁndings highlight the feasibility for clinicians to use a hip exosuit to directly target deﬁcits in limb advancement in hemiparetic gait.  1 Introduction  Stroke gait is slow, asymmetric, and metabolically inefﬁcient [1]. Motor deﬁcits of hip ﬂexors and ankle plantarﬂexors are known to contribute to impairments in gait speed and symmetry [2]. While several soft, modular, robotic systems seek to target the paretic ankle [3], actuating the hip may also augment locomotion in stroke. This study that assists hip ﬂexion during presents a proof-of-concept of a wearable exosuit walking in chronic stroke survivors. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of a hip exosuit on limb advancement during walking guided by clinical observations of a physical therapist.

Gregg  Abstract—This paper describes the design of a powered knee- and-ankle transfemoral prosthetic leg, which implements high torque density actuators with low-reduction transmissions. The low reduction of the transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible beneﬁts over modern actuation styles implemented in emerging robotic prosthetic legs. Such beneﬁts include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, and greater potential for power regeneration. Benchtop validation experiments were conducted to verify some of these beneﬁts. Backdrive and free- swinging knee tests conﬁrm that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (˜3 Nm). Bandwidth tests reveal that the actuator is capable of achieving frequencies required for walk- ing and running. Lastly, open-loop impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufﬁciently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback.  into the user’s gait. By actively injecting energy into the user’s gait, powered prostheses have the capability to restore mobility and quality of life to those who live with the loss of a limb.  In the last decade, a great amount of research has gone into the design and control of powered prosthetic limbs [6], [7]. Many powered prosthetic devices have emerged from this research, several of which implement non-backdrivable actuators, consisting of high-speed, low-torque motors with high-ratio transmissions, such as ball screws or multiple gear stages [4], [6], [8]–[16].

Embry, Student Member, IEEE, Dario J. Villarreal, Member, IEEE, Rebecca L. Macaluso, and Robert D. Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Powered knee and ankle prostheses can perform a limited number of discrete ambulation tasks. This is largely due to their control architecture, which uses a ﬁnite-state machine to select among a set of task-speciﬁc controllers. A non-switching controller that supports a continuum of tasks is expected to better facilitate normative biomechanics. This paper introduces a predictive model that represents gait kinematics as a contin- uous function of gait cycle percentage, speed, and incline. The basis model consists of two parts: basis functions that produce kinematic trajectories over the gait cycle, and task functions that smoothly alter the weight of basis functions in response to task. Kinematic data from ten able-bodied subjects walking at twenty-seven combinations of speed and incline generate training and validation data for this data-driven model. Convex optimization accurately ﬁts the model to experimental data. Automated model order reduction improves predictive abilities by capturing only the most important kinematic changes due to walking tasks. Constraints on range of motion and jerk ensure the safety and comfort of the user. This model produces a smooth continuum of trajectories over task, an impossibility for ﬁnite-state control algorithms. Random sub-sampling validation indicates basis modeling predicts untrained kinematics more accurately than linear interpolation.  and minimizing back muscle activation related to the risk of low back pain [1].","id":"4815969f-cf6f-4fb1-8a20-e44477c225e5"}

First published January 6, 2011; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.00505.2010.—Muscles expend energy to perform active work during locomotion, but they may also expend signiﬁcant energy to produce force, for example when tendons perform much of the work passively. The relative contribu- tions of work and force to overall energy expenditure are unknown. We therefore measured the mechanics and energetics of a cyclical bouncing task, designed to control for work and force. We hypothe- sized that near bouncing resonance, little work would be performed actively by muscle, but the cyclical production of force would cost substantial metabolic energy. Human subjects (n  9) bounced vertically about the ankles at inversely proportional frequencies (1–4 Hz) and amplitudes (15–4 mm), such that the overall rate of work performed on the body remained approximately constant (0.30  0.06 W\/kg), but the forces varied considerably. We used parameter iden- tiﬁcation to estimate series elasticity of the triceps surae tendon, as well as the work performed actively by muscle and passively by tendon. Net metabolic energy expenditure for bouncing at 1 Hz was 1.15  0.31 W\/kg, attributable mainly to active muscle work with an efﬁciency of 24  3%. But at 3 Hz (near resonance), most of the work was performed passively, so that active muscle work could account for only 40% of the net metabolic rate of 0.76  0.28 W\/kg. Near resonance, a cost for cyclical force that increased with both amplitude and frequency of force accounted for at least as much of the total energy expenditure as a cost for work. Series elasticity reduces the need for active work, but energy must still be expended for force production.  elastic energy; movement efﬁciency; resonant frequency","id":"69e33309-38e1-4f86-acc7-fd4c40647413"}

Without expert guidance, people can even increase the risk of injury by choosing a comfortable posture rather than the appropriate one, notably when lifting objects. Even in situations where squatting is accepted as a desirable lifting strategy, people tend to choose the more comfortable strategy of stooping or semisquatting. The common approach to correcting lifting posture, immobilizing vulnerable joints via fixation, is insufficient for preventing back injuries sustained from repetitive lifting. Instead, when lifting small but heavy objects, the entire kinetic chain should cooperate to achieve a series of squat-lifting patterns. Inspired by the observation that force fields affect the coordination of voluntary human motion, we devised a passive exosuit embedded with a body-powered variable-impedance mechanism. The exosuit adds impedance to the human joints according to how far the wearer’s movement is from the squat-lifting trajectories so that it hinders stooping but facilitates squatting. In an experiment that entailed lifting a small 10-kg box, 10 first-time users changed their voluntary lifting motion closer to squatting on average. Simulation results based on recorded kinematic and kinetic data showed that this postural change reduced the compression force, shear force, and moment on the lumbosacral joint. Our work demonstrates the potential of using an exosuit to help people move in a desirable manner without requiring a complicated, bulky mechanical system.","id":"e077098a-f86a-423a-bb66-1020da1648cc"}

Young  Abstract—Lower limb exoskeletons provide assistance during the gait cycle using a state variable, one in particular is gait phase. This is crucial for the exoskeleton controller to provide the user accurate assistance. Conventional methods often utilize an event marker to estimate gait phase by computing the average stride time. However, this strategy has limitations in adapting to dynamic speeds. We developed a sensor fusion-based neural network model to estimate the gait phase in real-time that can adapt to dynamic speeds ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 m\/s. Ten able- bodied subjects walked with an exoskeleton using our estimator and were provided with corresponding torque assistance. Our best performing model had RMSE below 29 ms and 4% for real-time estimation and torque generation, respectively, reducing the estimation error by 36.0% (p < 0.01) and torque error by 40.9% (p < 0.001) compared to conventional methods. Our results indicate that creating a general user-independent model and additionally training on user-speciﬁc data outperforms the user- speciﬁc model and user-independent model.

This paper addresses the challenge of planar dynamic robotic walking over stochastically generated stepping stones with significant variations in step length and step height, and where the robot has knowledge about the location of the next discrete foothold only one step ahead. Specifically, our approach utilizes a two-step periodic gait optimization technique to build a library of gaits parametrized by their resulting step lengths and step heights, as well as the initial configuration of the robot. By doing so, we address the problems involved during step transition when switching between the different walking gaits. We then use gait interpo- lation in real-time to obtain the desired gait. The proposed method is successfully validated on ATRIAS, an underactuated, human-scale bipedal robot, to achieve precise footstep placement. With no change in step height, step lengths are varied in the range of [23:78] cm. When both step length and step height are changed, their variation are within [30:65] cm and [222:22] cm, respectively. The average walking speed of both these experiments is 0.6 m\/s.

A powered stairmill, integrated with a gait rehabilitation device, can potentially be used for training those who have difﬁculty climbing stairs. In order to assess the effec- tiveness of such an approach, it is necessary to understand the similarities and differences in walking on regular stairs and on a stairmill. We have conducted an experiment to compare the differences in kine- matics and muscle activations during climbing on regular stairs and a stairmill. Twelve subjects partic- ipated in this study. They ﬁrst walked on regular stairs ﬁve times and then performed a one-minute continuous walking on a stairmill. The results showed several important differences. During continuous walking on a stairmill, when compared to regular stairs, there was (i) an increase in the percentage of stance phase during a walking cycle, (ii) a higher angle of plantarﬂexion of the ankle during the transition from stance phase to swing phase, and (iii) a decrease in muscle activation of the tibialis anterior during swing phase. These differences would provide additional insights into the design of future rehabilitation systems and to interpret human data obtained from stairmills.   2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.  1.

In this paper, we propose the robust version of BL S (RBL S) to treat the data modeling with outliers. By assuming the regression residual and output weights follow their respective distributions, the objective function for RBLS is derived and the output weights for robust modeling can be determined by maximum a posterior estimation. Then the robustness of RBLS can be enhanced further by integrating the regularization theory. The Augmented Lagrange Multiplier method is utilized to optimize the novel models eﬃciently, and a solid theoretical proof is given to guarantee that the proposed RBLS is more robust than the standard BLS. Extensive ex- periments on function approximation and real-world regression are carried out to demonstrate that our proposed RBLS model can achieve a better modeling performance in uncertain data environment than the standard BLS and other regression algorithms.  © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The controller makes use of gravity compensation, feedforward movement assistance, and reinforcement of isometric joint torques to achieve assistance without dictating the spatiotemporal nature of joint movement. The patient is allowed to self-select walking speed and is able to make trajectory adaptations to maintain balance without interference from the controller. The governing equations and the finite state machine which comprise the system are described herein. The control architecture was implemented in a lower-limb exoskeleton and a preliminary experimental assessment was conducted in which a patient with hemiparesis resulting from stroke walked with assistance from the exoskeleton. The patient exhibited improvements in fast gait speed, step length asymmetry, and stride length in each session, as measured before and after exoskeleton training, presumably as a result of using the exoskeleton. I. INTRODUCTION Each year, approximately 800,000 people in the US suffer a stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), of which approximately 200,000 survivors are affected by lower-extremity hemiparesis to an extent that prevents walking without assistance six months after [1, 2]. Typical gait deficits in lower-limb-affected post-stroke individuals involve a combination of impaired muscle strength, coordination and proprioception, and often excessive muscle tone in the paretic limb. The two most immediate biomechanical effects of these impairments are instability of the paretic leg during the stance phase of gait, and insufficient foot clearance on the paretic side during the swing phase of gait. Given these biomechanical deficits, the movement objectives of post-stroke gait training primarily entail improving load acceptance on the paretic leg during stance, and improving foot clearance of the paretic leg via increased hip and knee flexion in the paretic leg during swing.

Walsh, Member, IEEE  Abstract In this paper, we present the design and characterization of the ExoBoot, a soft inflatable robotic boot for assisting ankle plantarflexion during walking. The ExoBoot integrates a soft textile-based actuator and an IMU sensor into a textile boot, making it low-profile and lightweight. The inflatable actuator generates assistive plantarflexion torque when pressurized by bending on top of the boot. We characterize the torque generated by the ExoBoot at various pressures and ankle angles, achieving a maximum torque of 39 Nm at 483 kPa (70 psi) and 60 degrees ankle angle. In order to evaluate the performance of the ExoBoot during walking, a pilot study with one healthy subject was conducted. Actuation is triggered by an open loop pressure controller, based on the ankle angular velocity measured by an IMU, using high flow rate solenoid valves. At the peak of active assistance, pressure in the actuator reaches 75% of the supply pressure, and maximum torque applied on the ankle is estimated to be 23 Nm. These results demonstrate potential for the ExoBoot to reduce the metabolic cost of walking.  I. INTRODUCTION  textiles anchored to the limbs. Cable transmission allows the heavier components to be worn on a more proximal body location such as the waist so that added inertia to the body can be minimized. However, this approach, when combined with interfacing to the body via functional apparel anchors, presents technical challenges in delivering comfortable and controlled assistance to the wearer.  Another approach explored by some groups for the development of lightweight wearable robots is the use of pneumatic or fluid-powered systems. This approach also enables power to be transmitted remotely so that components on the limb can be lightweight. One of the most common types of pneumatic actuator used in wearable robots is the McKibben actuator, which contracts when inflated and display force-length properties similar to those of skeletal muscles [11], [13], [14]. McKibben actuators are both compliant and able to generate large force, but a major caveat comes from their limited stroke length. Thus, when attached across a joint, these actuators can place constraints on the  motion.","id":"4471fdf0-830a-4c6a-9c64-cdd03453bbc1"}

The Relationship Between Joint Strength and Standing Vertical Jump Performance  Kuangyou B. Cheng National Cheng Kung University  The effect of joint strengthening on standing vertical jump height is investigated by computer simulation. The human model consists of five rigid segments representing the feet, shanks, thighs, HT (head and trunk), and arms. Segments are connected by frictionless revolute joints and model movement is driven by joint torque actuators. Each joint torque is the product of maximum isometric torque and three variable functions of instantaneous joint angle, angular velocity, and activation level, respectively. Jumping movements starting from a balanced ini- tial posture and ending at takeoff are simulated. A matching simulation reproducing the actual jumping movement is generated by optimizing joint activation level. Simulations with the goal of maximizing jump height are repeated for varying maximum isometric torque of one joint by up to ±20% while keeping other joint strength values unchanged. Similar to previous studies, reoptimization of activation after joint strengthening is necessary for increasing jump height. The knee and ankle are the most effective joints in changing jump height (by as much as 2.4%, or 3 cm). For the same amount of percentage increase\/ decrease in strength, the shoulder is the least effective joint (which changes height by as much as 0.6%), but its influence should not be overlooked.  Keywords: strengthening, joint torque, muscular activation, optimization, simulation  height have been investigated by mathematical models of increasing complexity (Levine et al., 1983a, 1983b; Pandy et al., 1990; Van Soest et al., 1993; Selbie & Caldwell, 1996). Ground reaction forces (GRF), muscle electromyogram (EMG), and joint kinematics have been measured by numerous experimental studies (Bobbert & Van Ingen Schenau, 1988; Lees et al., 2004).

Keya Ghonasgi, Jiyeon Kang, and Sunil K. Agrawal*  Abstract— In a previous study, a Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) was used to successfully retrain crouch gait of children with Cerebral Palsy by applying a downward force on the pelvis during walking on a treadmill. While the results of this study were promising, an important issue was translating these results to special needs children with crouch gait using simpler alternative procedures. This motivates the present study to compare the biomechanical differences in walking under two conditions: (i) the TPAD applies a pure downward force on the pelvis using tethers, and (ii) a weighted pelvic belt is used to apply the same downward force on the pelvis. In the second case the weight belt also increases the mass at the pelvis.  Ten healthy subjects performed two separate experiments while walking on an instrumented treadmill. The whole-body kinematics was recorded using a motion capture system and the ground reaction forces were measured by force plates embedded in the treadmill. We found no significant difference in the actual gait parameters of healthy subjects when the downwards force, equivalent to 15% body weight, applied by the TPAD was replaced by a weighted pelvic belt of 15% body weight. However, the estimated maximum ankle torque, predicted by an inverted pendulum mathematical model, during the single support phase showed a higher increase during walking with the weight belt when compared to a pure downward force. This suggests that the weight belt, due to its simplicity, may be a better medium to translate the results of TPAD in children with cerebral palsy who have a crouch gait.  I. INTRODUCTION Human walking has been studied extensively over the years. Simplified inverted pendulum models have been proposed to predict the human gait and estimate stability using the Zero Moment Point [1]. However, it is still a challenge to satisfactorily predict walking under different experimental conditions.  vertical direction and propulsion of Inertial Mass (IM) in the direction of progression, are of particular interest during a gait cycle.

In compliance with human motion and the human body, the device not only ﬁts tightly to the lower body of a wearer, but also transmits the assisting torque to the hip\/knee joint efﬁciently and comfortably. To over- come the poor wearability and assistive performance of conventional wearable walking assistance devices, three novel mechanisms are proposed: ﬁrst, a dual reduction actuator, which makes the mechanism more compact with minimal resistance, second, compliant joints, which adapt to human motion regardless of the wearing state, wearing position, and three-dimensional human joint motions, and third, a ﬂexible foot\/ankle mechanism, which helps in rigidly transmitting the assisting force only to the forefoot.

However, if the target group is extended to the geriatric popu- lation with moderate impairments, and the place of use extends to the home rather than to the hospital, the following additional requirements should be considered.

Tommaso Ranzani, Sheila Russo, & Conor Walsh School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA  ABSTRACT  Recently, there has been a growing interest in moving away from traditional rigid exoskeletons towards soft exosuits that can provide a variety of advantages including a reduction in both the weight carried by the wearer and the inertia experienced as the wearer flexes and extends their joints. These advantages are achieved by using structured functional textiles in combination with a flexible actuation scheme that enables assistive torques to be applied to the biological joints. Understanding the human- suit interface in these systems is important, as one of the key challenges with this approach is applying force to the human body in a manner that is safe, comfortable, and effective. This paper outlines a methodology for characterizing the structured functional textile of soft exosuits and then uses that methodology to evaluate several factors that lead to different suit-human series stiffnesses and pressure distributions over the body. These factors include the size of the force distribution area and the composition of the structured functional textile. Following the test results, design guidelines are suggested to maximize the safety, comfort, and efficiency of the exosuit.  INTRODUCTION  FIGURE 1.

{"query":"给我找有关外骨骼机器人站立期伸展扭矩控制的研究。","key_words":" 外骨骼机器人 站立期伸展扭矩控制","content":"1 Abstract—The most common gait pathology observed in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) is crouch gait, which is characterized by excessive knee flexion as well as other symptoms, such as spasticity and muscle weakness. A pair of bilateral knee exoskeletons can potentially reduce crouch gait in this population; doing so would presumably enhance mobility for such individuals. This paper describes the implementation of a knee exoskeleton and control approach intended to improve knee kinematics in an individual with CP. The knee exoskeleton provides extension torque to combat crouch during stance and employs trajectory control to encourage knee flexion and extension during swing. The device and controller were tested on a single adult individual with CP. Though the device and controller achieved the desired local effect, the step length and walking speed of the participant were reduced. I. INTRODUCTION Cerebral Palsy (CP) has an incidence rate of approximately 2 out of every 1000 births [1], and represents the most common physical disability in children [2]. Individuals with CP often exhibit irregular gait patterns, the most common of which, crouch gait, is characterized by excessive knee flexion [3]. Crouch gait can lead to joint pain and degradation, not only at the knee but also at other joints of the lower limb [4]. As such, the mobility of individuals with CP is often limited and degrades with age [5]. Recently, exoskeletons have emerged and become a viable approach to augment lower limb motion, and it is reasonable to conjecture that a powered exoskeletal device could reduce crouch gait and facilitate improved walking movement in individuals with CP. While prior work has explored the rehabilitative potential of exoskeleton assistance in children [6-9], this paper explores the ability of an exoskeleton to improve the kinematics and mobility of an adult participant during level-ground walking. As shown in [10], crouch gait is characterized by a substantially flexed nominal knee angle throughout the gait cycle, and a substantially decreased range of motion of the knee. This deviation from healthy patterns is accompanied also by a more dorsiflexed average ankle angle, and a reduced ankle range of motion. Unlike knee and ankle motion, sagittal plane motion of the hip is quite similar to that exhibited during healthy gait","id":"abfd52fd-2527-4cc1-a734-be9f6eac4db3"}

When defining requirements for any wearable robot for walking assistance, it is important to maximize the user’s metabolic benefit resulting from the exosuit assistance while limiting the metabolic penalty of carrying the system’s mass. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the relationship between assistance magnitude and the metabolic cost of walking while also examining changes to the wearer’s underlying gait mechanics. The study was performed with a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit during normal walking, where assistance was di- rectly applied at the ankle joint and indirectly at the hip due to a textile architecture. The exosuit controller was designed such that the delivered torque profile at the ankle joint approximated that of the biological torque during normal walking. Seven participants walked on a treadmill at 1.5 meters per second under one unpowered and four powered conditions, where the peak moment applied at the ankle joint was varied from about 10 to 38% of biological ankle moment (equivalent to an applied force of 18.7 to 75.0% of body weight). Results showed that, with increasing exosuit assistance, net metabolic rate continually decreased within the tested range. When maximum assistance was applied, the metabolic rate of walking was reduced by 22.83 ± 3.17% relative to the powered-off condition (mean ± SEM).","id":"73d129c7-ad0b-4999-9632-4c172fecff6e"}

Kinetic data were standardized to body mass and height.  Findings. Paired-samples t tests showed signiﬁcantly greater hip and knee angles (mean diﬀerence standard deviation (SD): hip 28.10 (SD 4.08), knee 3.39 (SD 7.20)) and hip and knee moments (hip 0.25 N m\/kg (SD 0.18), knee 0.17 N m\/kg (SD 0.15)) during stair ascent compared to descent. Signiﬁcantly greater ankle dorsiﬂexion angles (9.90 (SD 3.80)) and plantarﬂexion angles (8.78 (SD 4.80)) were found during stair descent compared to ascent. Coeﬃcient of variation (mean (SD)) in percentage between repeated tests varied for joint angles and moments, respectively (2.35% (SD 1.83)–17.53% (SD 13.62)) and (4.65% (SD 2.99)–40.73% (SD 24.77)).  Interpretation. Stair ascent was shown to be the more demanding biomechanical task when compared to stair descent for healthy young subjects. The ﬁndings from the current study provide baseline measures for pathological studies, theoretical joint modelling, and for mechanical joint simulators.  2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Kuo, J. Maxwell Donelan  A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deﬁcits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deﬁcits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies.

In addition to walking on ﬂat terrain, the y are evolving to handle advanced scenarios such as stairs, allowing for a wider range of activities. To facilitate this advancement, an effective and safe tool is required for the planning and generation of gait trajectories.

Subsequently, a Bézier curve-based path interpolation approach is introduced to generate the path between each state. Finally, a time scaling and path reparameterization method is employed to avoid the singularity problem. Two kinds of numerical simulations and real exoskeleton experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively and safely generate the trajectories to as- sist users in ascending stairs. Additionally, the effectiveness of the exoskeleton’s assistance is veriﬁed through a comparison of electromyography (EMG) signals from seven muscles. The results show that there was a reduction in muscle activation ranging from 22% to 81% for the different muscles analyzed.

INTRODUCTION  A CCORDINGtotheWorldHealthOrganization,morethan  70 million people currently suffer from different kinds of mobility disorders [1].

These active wear- able robots allow humans to overcome their physical limitations by providing additive joint power.

This technique has been used to produce large reductions in energy expenditure during walking with exoskeletons but has not yet been applied to prosthetic devices. In this series of case studies, we applied human-in-the-loop optimization to the control of an active ankle-foot prosthesis used by amputation. We participants with unilateral optimized the parameters of five control architectures that captured aspects of successful exoskeletons and commercial prostheses, but none resulted in significantly lower metabolic rate than generic control. In one control architecture, we increased the exposure time per condition by a factor of five, but the optimized controller still resulted in higher metabolic rate. Finally, we optimized for self-reported comfort instead the resulting controller was not of metabolic rate, but preferred. There are several reasons why human-in-the-loop optimization may have failed for people with amputation. Control architecture is an unlikely cause given the variety of controllers tested. The lack of effect likely relates to changes in motor adaptation, learning, or objectives in people with amputation. Future work should investigate these potential causes to determine whether human-in-the-loop optimization for prostheses could be successful.

For instance, the most established control method used on powered leg prostheses tracks local joint impedance functions without taking the global function of the leg in balance recovery into account. Here we explore an alternative control policy for powered transfemoral prostheses that considers the global leg function and is based on a neuromuscular model of human locomotion. Methods: We adapt this model to describe and simulate an amputee walking with a powered prosthesis using the proposed control, and evaluate the gait robustness when confronted with rough ground and swing leg disturbances. We then implement and partially evaluate the resulting controller on a leg prosthesis prototype worn by a non-amputee user. Results: In simulation, the proposed prosthesis control leads to more robust walking than the impedance control method. The initial hardware experiments with the prosthesis prototype show that the proposed control reproduces normal walking patterns qualitatively and eﬀectively responds to disturbances in early and late swing. However, the response to mid-swing disturbances neither replicates human responses nor averts falls. Conclusions: The neuromuscular model control is a promising alternative to existing prosthesis controls, although further research will need to improve on the initial implementation and to determine how well these results transfer to amputee gait. Signiﬁcance: This work provides a potential avenue for future development of control policies that help improve amputee balance recovery.  as they cannot generate positive net work over a gait cycle. Consequently, transfemoral amputees wearing these prostheses suﬀer from increased energy consumption, slower ambulation speeds, and a limited ability to respond to unexpected distur- bances such as trips, slips and pushes [3], [4].","id":"b2653ae6-3668-4d68-a224-ae171eaa1984"}

The controller makes use of gravity compensation, feedforward movement assistance, and reinforcement of isometric joint torques to achieve assistance without dictating the spatiotemporal nature of joint movement. The patient is allowed to self-select walking speed and is able to make trajectory adaptations to maintain balance without interference from the controller. The governing equations and the finite state machine which comprise the system are described herein. The control architecture was implemented in a lower-limb exoskeleton and a preliminary experimental assessment was conducted in which a patient with hemiparesis resulting from stroke walked with assistance from the exoskeleton. The patient exhibited improvements in fast gait speed, step length asymmetry, and stride length in each session, as measured before and after exoskeleton training, presumably as a result of using the exoskeleton. I. INTRODUCTION Each year, approximately 800,000 people in the US suffer a stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), of which approximately 200,000 survivors are affected by lower-extremity hemiparesis to an extent that prevents walking without assistance six months after [1, 2]. Typical gait deficits in lower-limb-affected post-stroke individuals involve a combination of impaired muscle strength, coordination and proprioception, and often excessive muscle tone in the paretic limb. The two most immediate biomechanical effects of these impairments are instability of the paretic leg during the stance phase of gait, and insufficient foot clearance on the paretic side during the swing phase of gait. Given these biomechanical deficits, the movement objectives of post-stroke gait training primarily entail improving load acceptance on the paretic leg during stance, and improving foot clearance of the paretic leg via increased hip and knee flexion in the paretic leg during swing. These objectives have traditionally been pursued by a combination of physiotherapy (e.g., mat exercises, weight training, use of fitness equipment) and assisted overground gait training. These may be supplemented with body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) or robotically assisted treadmill training. Various methods have been proposed to control the patient-robot interaction in robotically-assisted BWSTT systems [3-7]. Research supported by U.S","id":"622b1815-81bd-4087-b2a0-05ef81303a85"}

In this paper, we present a new version of autonomous multi-joint soft exosuit for gait assistance, particularly designed for overground walking. The soft exosuit assists with ankle plantarflexion, hip flexion, and hip extension, equally distributing the forces between ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion. A mobile actuation system was developed to generate high assistive forces, and Bowden cables are used to transmit the forces to the exosuit. A sensor harness connects two load cells and three IMUs per leg that are used to measure real-time data for a controller that commands desired force profiles as a function of the walking cycle. In addition, a control adaptation method was developed which adjusts control parameters while walking on irregular surfaces. In preliminary studies, the proposed method substantially improved the force consistency while walking over uneven terrain. Specifically, the number of steps where the peak force deviated from the target force decreased from 100 to 57 out of 250 steps, and RMS error on the peak force decreased from 90.0 N to 76.6 N with respect to 300 N target force. Also, a two-subject case study on country-course walking demonstrated the potential of this soft exosuit to improve human energy economy while walking overground. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, lower-limb wearable devices have been developed to assist with human walking. Applications of these devices include assisting individuals with disabilities to relieve their gait deficits [1-2] and augmenting healthy people to improve the energy economy during walking [3-5] or load carriage [6-7]. Conventionally these devices have consisted of rigid structures which enables to deliver high assistive torques to the wearer and to transfer carried load directly to the ground [7]. However, when misaligned with the wearer’s biological joints, the rigid frames may restrict the natural motion of the wearer and apply undesired forces [7-8]. Moreover, rigid structures may add large inertia to the wearer’s lower limb, which is associated with increased energy expenditure during walking [9]. This material is based upon the work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Warrior Web Program (Contract No. W911NF-14-C-0051), the Samsung Scholarship, and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (Grant No. DGE1144152)","id":"0b95fd57-fac8-4a05-b2f3-a49214dadcfe"}

Quintero, Member, IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes a powered lower-limb orthosis that is intended to provide gait assistance to spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals by providing assistive torques at both hip and knee joints. The orthosis has a mass of 12 kg and is capable of providing maximum joint torques of 40 Nm with hip and knee joint ranges of motion from 105 ﬂexion to 30 extension and 105 ﬂexion to 10 hyperextension, respectively. A custom distributed embedded system controls the orthosis with power being provided by a lithium polymer battery which provides power for one hour of continuous walking. In order to demonstrate the ability of the orthosis to assist walking, the orthosis was experimentally imple- mented on a paraplegic subject with a T10 complete injury. Data collected during walking indicates a high degree of step-to-step re- peatabilityofhipandkneetrajectories(asenforcedbytheorthosis) and an average walking speed of 0.8 km\/hr. The electrical power required at each hip and knee joint during gait was approximately 25 and 27 W, respectively, contributing to the 117 W overall elec- trical power required by the device during walking.

The goals of this study were to 1) systematically investigate the biomechanics of a wearer-robot system reacting to internal errors induced by a powered knee prosthesis (PKP), and 2) quantify the error tolerable bound that does not affect the user’s gait stability. Eight non-disabled participants and two unilat- eral transfemoral amputees walked on a pathway wearing a PKP, as the controller randomly switched the control parameters to disturbance parameters to mimic the errors caused by locomotion mode misrecognition. The size of prosthesiscontrolerrorswas systematicallyvariedto deter- mine the error tolerable bound that disrupted gait stabil- ity. The effect of the error was quantiﬁed based on the 1) mechanical change described by the angular impulse applied by the PKP, and 2) overall gait instability quantiﬁed using human perception, angular momentum, and compen- satory stepping. The results showed that the error tolerable bound is dependent on the gait phase and the direction of torque change. Two balance recovery strategies were also observed to allow participants to successful respond to the induced errors. The outcomes of this study may assist the future design of an auto-tuning algorithm, volitionally- controlled powered prosthetic legs, and training of gait stability.

This paper addresses the challenge of planar dynamic robotic walking over stochastically generated stepping stones with significant variations in step length and step height, and where the robot has knowledge about the location of the next discrete foothold only one step ahead. Specifically, our approach utilizes a two-step periodic gait optimization technique to build a library of gaits parametrized by their resulting step lengths and step heights, as well as the initial configuration of the robot. By doing so, we address the problems involved during step transition when switching between the different walking gaits. We then use gait interpo- lation in real-time to obtain the desired gait. The proposed method is successfully validated on ATRIAS, an underactuated, human-scale bipedal robot, to achieve precise footstep placement. With no change in step height, step lengths are varied in the range of [23:78] cm. When both step length and step height are changed, their variation are within [30:65] cm and [222:22] cm, respectively. The average walking speed of both these experiments is 0.6 m\/s.  Keywords Bipedal robot, stepping stones, gait library  1. Introduction  A primary advantage of legged robotic systems over their wheeled counterparts is their ability to navigate over rugged terrain such as over discrete footholds or ‘‘stepping stones.’’ Unlike prior work that rely on simplistic robot models (such as pendulum models) and fully actuated control schemes (e.g. zero moment point (ZMP)) to achieve the desired foot placements, in this work, we propose a formal framework that achieves planar dynamic underactuated walking over a randomly varying discrete terrain with significant simulta- neous changes in step length and step height at each step.","id":"318518c7-a215-4196-ad5e-858460bf1db1"}

ACCEPTED JUNE, 2020 1  Abstract— Lower-limb exoskeletons are widely researched to improve walking performance and mobility. Low-level sensor-less exoskeleton motor control is attractive for consumer applications due to reduced device complexity and cost, but complex and variable transmission system configurations make the development of effective open-loop motor controllers that are responsive to user input challenging. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an open-loop motor control framework resulting in similar or greater performance vs. closed-loop torque control. We used generalized linear regression to develop two open-loop controllers by modeling motor current during exoskeleton-assisted walking; a “complex” model used desired torque and estimated ankle angular velocity as inputs, while a “simple” model used desired torque alone. Five participants walked at 1.0-1.3 m\/s on a treadmill with closed-loop and both open-loop controllers providing ankle exoskeleton assistance. Both open-loop current controllers had similar root-mean-squared torque tracking error (p=0.23) compared to the closed-loop torque-feedback controller. Both open-loop controllers had improved relative average torque production (p<0.001 complex, p=0.022 simple), lower power consumption (p<0.001 for both), and reduced operating noise (p=0.002 complex, p<0.001 simple) over the closed-loop controller. New control models developed for a different ankle exoskeleton configuration showed similar improvements (lower torque error, greater average and peak torque production, lower power consumption) over closed-loop control during over-ground walking. These results demonstrate that our framework can produce open-loop motor controllers that match closed-loop control performance during exoskeleton operation.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Powered knee and ankle prosthesis with indirect volitional swing control enables level-ground walking and crossing over obstacles Joel Mendez, Sarah Hood, Andy Gunnel, Tommaso Lenzi*  Powered prostheses aim to mimic the missing biological limb with controllers that are finely tuned to replicate the nominal gait pattern of non-amputee individuals. Unfortunately, this control approach poses a problem with real-world ambulation, which includes tasks such as crossing over obstacles, where the prosthesis trajectory must be modified to provide adequate foot clearance and ensure timely foot placement. Here, we show an indirect volitional control approach that enables prosthesis users to walk at different speeds while smoothly and continuously crossing over obstacles of different sizes without explicit classification of the environment. At the high level, the proposed controller relies on a heuristic algorithm to continuously change the maximum knee flexion angle and the swing duration in harmony with the user’s residual limb. At the low level, minimum-jerk planning is used to continuously adapt the swing trajectory while maximizing smoothness. Experiments with three individuals with above-knee amputation show that the proposed control approach allows for volitional control of foot clearance, which is necessary to negotiate environmental barriers. Our study suggests that a powered prosthesis controller with intrinsic, volitional adaptability may provide prosthesis users with functionality that is not currently available, facilitating real-world ambulation.","id":"84d1eb26-eccb-4869-b25c-7d7a013b0007"}

Integrating an electromagnetic brake to a crossing four-bar knee joint with a compact design, the passive knee exoskeleton enables the polycentric knee center of rotation covering the wide range of knee angle during stair ascent. For preliminary validation, the surface electromyography (EMG) of rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) were studied on a healthy male volunteer wearing the exoskeleton on his right leg. The reduction of peak muscle activity is observed as the brake torque is applied during knee extension while the knee flexion moment is required. Keywords—prosthetics and exoskeletons, physically assistive devices, wearable robots I. INTRODUCTION The global average life expectancy is increasing with the advances in medical care. Having high percentage of elderly population, many countries have become a full-fledged aged society. Because aging process leads to evident losses of the muscle mass and strength [1], several types of human motion assist system are required for elderly to support their daily activities covering a great variety of lifestyles. With the advance in physical human–robot interaction, exoskeletons–consisting of external structures covering human limbs and joints–could provide mechanical power directly to physically weaken users such as elderly, disabled and injured people. Enabling a human to perceive a good quality life, walking ability is one of the most important fundamental function. As wearable walking support systems, powered leg exoskeletons were extensively developed not only for assisting patients and elderly who encounter with difficulties in motion due to weakened leg muscles [2] but also for enhancing walking performance of healthy individuals [3]","id":"9d87b94c-93db-46c9-ad7f-d8d1cf8daa8b"}

Powered Hip Exoskeletons can Reduce the User’s Hip and Ankle Muscle Activations during Walking  T. Lenzi, Student Member IEEE, M.C. Carrozza, Member, IEEE, and S.K. Agrawal Member, IEEE  Abstract— In this paper, we study the human locomotor adaptation to the action of a powered exoskeleton providing assistive torque at the user’s hip during walking. To this end, we propose a controller that provides the user’s hip with a fraction of the nominal torque profile, adapted to the specific gait features of the user from Winter’s reference data [34]. The assistive controller has been implemented on the ALEX II exoskeleton and tested on ten healthy subjects. Experimental results show that when assisted by the exoskeleton, users can reduce the muscle effort compared to free walking. Despite providing assistance only to the hip joint, both hip and ankle muscles significantly reduced their activation, indicating a clear tradeoff between hip and ankle strategy to propel walking.  muscle strength and endurance (e.g., myopathies) [14], or lowering the maximum sustainable cardiac effort (e.g., peripheral arterial diseases) [15]. A pathological condition of the lower-limb articulations (e.g., hip pain, osteoarthritis) can result in an onset of pain that reduces the patient’s walking ability as well [16]. In either case, by using an assistive exoskeleton that can reduce the muscle force required to walk, patients might recover their normal movement ability and improve their physical and social health [17]-[19]. The growing elderly population increases the incidence of these pathologies, and together with longer life expectancy, the study of non-pharmacological solutions. motivates Assistive exoskeletons may present an alternative way of restoring normal walking in these population groups.

The neural circuitry that facilitates automaticity is impaired by stroke, resulting in a compensatory shift toward executive-control, as well as reduced paretic propulsion and increased step-to-step variability. We have developed a soft robotic exosuit to augment paretic propulsion by providing paretic plantarflexor assistance during the propulsive phase of walking. For this preliminary study, we hypothesized that changes in walking automaticity would accompany changes in paretic propulsion.

Numerous studies discuss the design and control of various exoskeleton mechanisms, yet rela- tively few address the effect on the energy expenditure of the user. In this paper we report the effects of using a knee exoskeleton on the metabolic cost of periodic squatting. By measur- ing oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, heart rate, blood oxygenation and EMG signals during 5 minute squatting series, with a frequency of one squat every 2 seconds, we show the effects of using the knee exoskeleton under three different control methods: gravity compensa- tion approach, oscillator based approach and position based approach. Statistically signiﬁcant differences in physiological responses emerge when using the knee exoskeleton under gravity compensation and oscillator based control. On the other hand, effects of position based control cannot be deemed statistically signiﬁcant.  Keywords. exoskeleton, knee, squatting, metabolic cost, K4  1.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  The game of curling can be considered a good test bed for studying the interaction between artificial intelligence systems and the real world. In curling, the environmental characteristics change at every moment, and every throw has an impact on the outcome of the match. Furthermore, there is no time for relearning during a curling match due to the timing rules of the game. Here, we report a curling robot that can achieve human-level performance in the game of curling using an adaptive deep reinforcement learning framework. Our proposed adaptation framework extends standard deep reinforcement learning using temporal features, which learn to compensate for the uncer- tainties and nonstationarities that are an unavoidable part of curling. Our curling robot, Curly, was able to win three of four official matches against expert human teams [top-ranked women’s curling teams and Korea national wheelchair curling team (reserve team)]. These results indicate that the gap between physics-based simulators and the real world can be narrowed.  INTRODUCTION Applying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to the real world (1–7) is a challenging problem. Operating beyond the confines of a laboratory means dealing with unknown factors, such as an environ- ment that varies over time, that can have an effect on the performance of an AI system (8, 9). Moreover, the real world offers many uncer- tainties, which may be too complex and ill defined to be modeled with sufficient accuracy (10). Thus, it is necessary to incorporate uncertainty into modeling efforts and to measure and approximate changes in real-world environments (5–7).","id":"629a3a53-7479-4db0-855c-4e527ba5d541"}

To address this challenge, we derived a novel analytical ankle joint moment estimation model using custom wearable sensors and developed an exoskeleton control scheme to adapt assistance proportional to the biological plantar-ﬂexor moment in real-time for unimpaired individuals and individuals with disabilities who are able to ambulate independently. We validated the controller ◦ incline and decline walking, each at multiple during level, 5 ◦ turning (88 ± 3% speeds; stair ascent; stair descent; and 90 average accuracy, R = 0.96 ± 0.01 average correlation coefﬁcient).

Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Positive biomechanical outcomes have been re- ported with lower-limb exoskeletons in laboratory settings, but these devices have difﬁculty delivering appropriate assistance in synchronywith human gait as the task or rate of phase progression change in real-world environments. This paper presents a torque controller for an ankle exoskeleton that uses state estimation with a data-driven kinematic model to continuously estimate the phase, phase rate, stride length, and ramp parameters during locomotion. The controller applies torque assistance based on the estimated phase and adapts the torque proﬁle based on the estimated task variables to match human torques observed in a multi-activity database of 10 able-bodied subjects. We demonstrate in silico that the controller yields phase estimates that are more accurate than state of the art, while also estimating task variables with compa- rable accuracy to recent machine learning approaches. The con- troller implemented in an ankle exoskeleton successfully adapts its assistance in response to changing phase and task variables, both during controlled treadmill trials (6 able-bodied subjects) and a real-world stress test with extremely uneven terrain.

For SCI individuals with an incomplete lesion and sufﬁcient hip control, we applied a trajectory-free neuromuscular control (NMC) strategy and used the exoskeleton in the ankle-knee conﬁguration. For complete SCI individuals, we used a combination of a NMC and an impedance based trajectory tracking strategy with theexoskeletonintheankle-knee-hipconﬁguration.Results of a preliminary evaluation of the developed hardware and software showed that SCI individuals with an incomplete lesion could naturally vary their walking speed and step length and walked faster compared to walking without the device.

There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in knee motion between the patients and normal subjects. The patients with knee OA had a signiﬁcantly reduced internal knee extensor moment compared to normal subjects. This diﬀerence reﬂects the patient’s compensation to reduce the knee joint loading. Further, subjects with OA and a higher body mass index have a lower knee extensor moment. The female subjects had signiﬁcantly greater knee ﬂexion and a greater knee extensor moment. This gender diﬀerence may partially explain the increased prevalence of OA in females. Most tests of OA treatments are assessed by criteria that do not reﬂect functional activities. This study demonstrates that objective gait analysis can be used to document gait adaptations used by patients with knee OA. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.  Keywords: Knee; Osteoarthritis; Gait; Body mass index; Stairs  1. Introduction  Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis in the elderly. This disease is particularly disabling when the knees are aﬀected. It is estimated that 9% of men and 18% of women over age 65 have knee OA (Davis et al., 1991). Individuals with knee OA experience pain, stiﬀness, and decreased range of motion of the joints. These symptoms signiﬁcantly limit an individual’s ability to rise from a chair, stand comfor- tably, walk, or climb stairs. Ultimately, these limitations lead to a loss of functional independence.

Gutierrez Farewik, and Ruoli Wang  Abstract—In recent decades, there has been an increasing interest in the use of robotic powered exoskeletons to assist patients with movement disorders in rehabilitation and daily life. Providing assistive torque that compensates for the user’s remaining muscle contributions is a growing and challenging ﬁeld within exoskeleton control. In this article, ankle joint torques were estimated using electromyography (EMG)-driven neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) model and an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) model in seven movement tasks, including fast walking, slow walking, self-selected speed walking, and isokinetic dorsi\/plantar ﬂexion at 60◦\/s and 90◦\/s. In each method, EMG signals and ankle joint angles were used as input, the models were trained with data from 3-D motion analysis, and ankle joint torques were predicted. Six cases using different motion trials as calibration (for the NMS model)\/training (for the ANN) were devised, and the agreement between the predicted and measured ankle joint torques was computed. We found that the NMS model could overall better predict ankle joint torques from EMG and angle data than the ANN model with some exceptions; the ANN predicted ankle joint torques with better agreement when trained with data from the same movement. The NMS model predicted ankle joint torque best when calibrated with trials during which EMG reached maximum levels, whereas the ANN predicted well when trained with many trials and types of movements. In addition, the ANN prediction may become less reliable when  predicting unseen movements. Detailed comparative studies of methods to predict ankle joint torque are crucial for determining strategies for exoskeleton control.","id":"71c940c2-8178-48dc-928c-ac46acb85e7f"}

Despite recent advances, few products are commercially available and exoskeleton research is still often limited by hardware constraints. Many promising multi-joint assistance strategies, especially those with high- torque and high-power components, have yet to be tested because they are beyond the capabilities of current devices. To study these untested assistance strategies, we present a hip–knee–ankle exoskeleton emulator that can apply high torques and powers that match or exceed those observed in uphill running. The system has powerful off-board motors that actuate a 13.5 kg exoskeleton end effector worn by the user. It can apply up to 200 Nm of torque in hip flexion, hip extension, and ankle plantarflexion, 250 Nm of torque in knee extension, and 140 Nm of torque in knee flexion, with over 4.5 kW of power at each joint and a closed-loop torque bandwidth of at least 18 Hz in each direction of actuation. The exoskeleton is compliant in unactuated directions, adjustable for a wide range of users and comfortable during walking and running. When paired with human-in-the-loop optimization, we expect that this system will identify new assistance strategies to improve human mobility. A complete computer-aided design (CAD) model of the exoskeleton and a bill of materials are included and available for download.

McLain3, Inseung Kang1, and Aaron J. Young1  Abstract— The knee joint performs a significant amount of positive or negative mechanical work during gradient walking, and targeted assistance during periods of high mechanical work could yield strong human augmentation benefits. This paper explores the biomechanical effects of providing knee extension assistance during the early stance phase of the gait cycle using a powered unilateral knee exoskeleton during gradient walking on able-bodied subjects. Twelve subjects walked on 15% gradient incline and decline surfaces with the exoskeleton providing knee extension assistance during the early stance phase of the gait cycle. For both incline and decline walking, the exoskeleton assistance reduced the muscle activation of the knee extensors on the assisted leg (p < 0.05). However, only approximately half the individuals responded to exoskeleton assistance positively by reducing their metabolic cost of walking for both incline and decline tasks. The results indicate that, unlike the individuals who did respond, the individuals who did not respond to the assistance may have penalized their metabolic cost by their biomechanical compensatory behaviors from the unassisted leg.

Lerner  Abstract—Lower-limb exoskeletons used to improve free-living mobility for individuals with neuromuscular impairment must be controlled to prescribe assistance that adapts to the diverse locomotor conditions encountered during daily life, including walking at different speeds and across varied terrain. The goal of this paper is to design and establish clinical feasibility of an ankle exoskeleton control strategy that instantly and appropriately adjusts assistance to the changing biomechanical demand dur- ing variable walking. To accomplish this goal, we devel- joint-moment control strategy that oped a proportional prescribes assistance as a function of the instantaneous estimate of the ankle joint moment and conducted a laboratory-based feasibility study. Four individuals with neuromotor impairment and one unimpaired individual completed exoskeleton-assisted slow and fast gait transi- tion tasks that involved gait initiation and changing walk- ing speed. We found that the controller was effective in instantaneously prescribing exoskeleton assistance that was proportional to the ankle moment with less than 14% root-mean-square error, on average. We also performed a three-subject pilot investigation to determine the ability of the proportionaljoint-momentcontrollerto improvewalking economy. Evaluated in two individuals with cerebral palsy and one unimpaired individual, metabolic cost of trans- port improved 17–27% during treadmill and over-ground walking with proportional control compared with wear- ing the exoskeleton unassisted.

Asbeck, Stefano Marco Maria De Rossi, Jaehyun Bae, Thiago Ribeiro Teles Santos, Vanessa Lara Araujo, Sangjun Lee, Kenneth G. Holt, Conor Walsh, Member, IEEE  Abstract--- To understand the effects of soft exosuits on human loaded walking, we developed a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide synchronized forces to the ankle and hip joints. Two different assistive strategies were evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.25 m\/s with a 23.8 kg backpack: 1) hip extension assistance and 2) multi-joint assistance (hip extension, ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion). Results show that the exosuit introduces minimum changes to kinematics and reduces biological joint moments. A reduction trend in muscular activity was observed for both conditions. On average, the exosuit reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 0.21 ± 0.04 W\/kg and 0.67 ± 0.09 W\/kg for hip extension assistance and multi-joint assistance respectively, which is equivalent to an average metabolic reduction of 4.6% and 14.6% demonstrating that soft exosuits can effectively improve human walking efficiency during load carriage without affecting natural walking gait. Moreover, it indicates that actuating multiple joints with soft exosuits provides a significant benefit to muscular activity and metabolic cost compared to actuating single joint.

This technique has been used to produce large reductions in energy expenditure during walking with exoskeletons but has not yet been applied to prosthetic devices. In this series of case studies, we applied human-in-the-loop optimization to the control of an active ankle-foot prosthesis used by amputation. We participants with unilateral optimized the parameters of five control architectures that captured aspects of successful exoskeletons and commercial prostheses, but none resulted in significantly lower metabolic rate than generic control. In one control architecture, we increased the exposure time per condition by a factor of five, but the optimized controller still resulted in higher metabolic rate. Finally, we optimized for self-reported comfort instead the resulting controller was not of metabolic rate, but preferred. There are several reasons why human-in-the-loop optimization may have failed for people with amputation. Control architecture is an unlikely cause given the variety of controllers tested. The lack of effect likely relates to changes in motor adaptation, learning, or objectives in people with amputation. Future work should investigate these potential causes to determine whether human-in-the-loop optimization for prostheses could be successful.

Lum, William J. Shelstad, Megan H. Harris, & Matthew M. White Penn State Erie, The Behrend College  Traditionally, robotics are created to be user friendly from a human standpoint but recently a different theory has emerged which focuses on how the technology we use may influence how human-like we perceive each other to be. This study investigates how individual differences play in to someone’s propensity to technomorphize. The first focus was on whether those in an engineering or programming field were more likely to technomorphize than those in other fields. The second focus was to continue the validation process for the technomorphism scale and examine how machine-like humans may be perceived. Results from this study showed that those in an engineering field or programming field are more likely to technomorphize than those in different fields.  INTRODUCTION  Recently, scientists at the University of Washington have created the first human-to-human brain interface. Electrical signals coming from one human’s brain are recorded, translated by the computer and then transmitted to another brain that signals the second human to move their hand. According to researchers “When the move-right- hand signal arrived from Rao, Stocco involuntarily moved his right index finger to push the space bar on the keyboard in front of him, as if firing the cannon. He said the feeling of his hand moving involuntarily was like that of a nervous tic” (Begley, 2013).","id":"dc1a436d-a531-468c-8e4d-fbe182e88dbf"}

However, existing intelli- gent servo control strategies for robot joints have problems of computational redundancy, limited prediction accuracy, and insufﬁcient generalization capability. To solve these problems, this article proposes a servo control strategy for robot joints that is based on the incremental Bayesian fuzzy broad learning system (IBFBLS). First, we construct an in- telligent servo control strategy with broad learning system on the basis of fuzzy rules to achieve good self-learning and generalization abilities. Second, the learning parameters of the control strategy are optimized by Bayesian inference to achieve precise joint servo control. Finally, the conver- gence of the control strategy is enhanced by combining it with Lyapunov theory to constrain the learning param- eters of the proposed control strategy. The feasibility and superiority of the proposed control strategy are veriﬁed by simulation to compare it with existing intelligent servo con- trol methods. In addition, experiments are conducted using robot joint test bed. Both the simulation and experiments verify that the proposed servo control strategy outperforms other servo control methods with respect to tracking ac- curacy, stability, and convergence. The root-mean-square error in servo control of robot joints was 0.012%, which has been reduced by 55.56% compared with the current state of the art.

In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to not only estimate but predict the joint moment in advance for multiple ambulation modes. By combining electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement units (IMU), and electro- goniometers, we enable the prediction of the joint moment only from wearable sensors. We performed a forward feature selection to determine the best feature sets for different anticipation times of the intended moment generated at the hip, knee, and ankle, encompassing level walking on a treadmill and ascent\/descent of stairs and ramps.

We found that the hip moment had a significantly lower error than the knee and ankle when anticipating the joint moment (Bonferroni test, p < 0.05).

Comparing optimized exoskeleton assistance of the hip, knee, and ankle in single and multi-joint conﬁgurations  Patrick W. Franks1,  , Gwendolyn M. Bryan1, Russell M. Martin1, Ricardo Reyes1, and Steven H. Collins1  1Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University  Exoskeletons that assist the hip, knee, and ankle joints have be- gun to improve human mobility, particularly by reducing the metabolic cost of walking. However, direct comparisons of op- timal assistance of these joints, or their combinations, have not yet been possible. Assisting multiple joints may be more bene- ﬁcial than the sum of individual effects, because muscles often span multiple joints, or less effective, because single-joint as- sistance can indirectly aid other joints. In this study, we used a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton emulator paired with human-in-the- loop optimization to ﬁnd single-joint, two-joint, and whole-leg assistance that maximally reduced the metabolic cost of walk- ing for three participants. Hip-only and ankle-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 26% and 30% relative to walking in the device unassisted, conﬁrming that both joints are good targets for assistance. Knee-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 13%, demonstrating that ef- fective knee assistance is possible. Two-joint assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by between 34% and 42%, with the largest improvements coming from hip-ankle assistance. As- sisting all three joints reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 50%, showing that at least half of the metabolic energy ex- pended during walking can be saved through exoskeleton as- sistance. Changes in kinematics and muscle activity indicate that single-joint assistance indirectly assisted muscles at other joints, such that the improvement from whole-leg assistance was smaller than the sum of its single-joint parts. Exoskeletons can assist the entire limb for maximum effect, but a single well- chosen joint can be more efﬁcient when considering additional factors such as weight and cost.

Although machine vision has recently proven to be a promising tool in identifying upcoming terrains in the travel path, existing approaches are limited to environment perception rather than human intent recognition that is essential for coordinated wearable robot operation. Hence, in this study, we aim to develop a novel system that fuses the human gaze (representing user intent) and machine vision (capturing environmental information) for accurate prediction of the user’s locomotion mode. The system pos- sessesmultimodalvisualinformationandrecognizesuser’s locomotion intent in a complex scene, where multiple ter- rains are present. Additionally, based on the dynamic time warping algorithm, a fusion strategy was developed to align temporal predictions from individual modalities while pro- ducing ﬂexible decisions on the timing of locomotion mode transition for wearable robot control. System performance was validated using experimental data collected from ﬁve participants, showing high accuracy (over 96% in average) of intent recognition and reliable decision-making on loco- motion transition with adjustable lead time. The promising results demonstrate the potential of fusing human gaze and machine vision for locomotion intent recognition of lower limb wearable robots.

Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the virtual anchor technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best accept load. Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit’s performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated the effect of the ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer’s hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking. Wearing the suit in a passive unpowered mode had little effect on hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics as compared to baseline walking when not wearing the suit. Engaging the actuators at the ankles at 30% of the gait cycle for 250 ms altered joint kinematics the least and also minimized metabolic power. The subject’s average metabolic power was 386.7 W, almost identical to the average power when wearing no suit (381.8 W), and substantially less than walking with the unpowered suit (430.6 W). This preliminary work demonstrates that the exosuit can comfortably transmit joint torques to the user while not restricting mobility and that with further optimization, has the potential to reduce the wearer’s metabolic cost during walking. I. INTRODUCTION Over the last two decades, a number of exoskeletons have been developed for tasks ranging from heavy lifting [1] to helping the wearer to walk [2-6] and for providing robotic rehabilitation therapy in a hospital setting [7]. Recently, with improvements in actuator and sensor technology we have seen these systems become portable, and begin to transition from academic to commercial applications. Several categories of exoskeletons exist, including those that provide the ability to replace human movements that have been completely lost, e.g. in the case of a patient paralyzed below the waist","id":"932d64ab-55ae-4981-9f13-fb9cf4b53996"}

However, designing such a device for seamless integration with the human user and to assist human movement still is a major challenge. This paper aims at developing a novel data-driven solution framework based on reinforcement learning (RL), without first modeling the human-robot dynamics, to provide optimal and adaptive personalized torque assistance for reducing human efforts during walking. Our automatic personalization solution framework includes the assistive torque profile with two control timing parameters (peak and offset timings), the least square policy iteration (LSPI) for learning the parameter tuning policy, and a cost function based on transferred work ratio. The proposed controller was successfully validated on a healthy human subject to assist unilateral hip extension in walking. The results showed that the optimal and adaptive RL controller as a new approach was feasible for tuning assistive torque profile of the hip exoskeleton that coordinated with human actions and reduced activation level of hip extensor muscle in human.  Wherein, hip flexion\/extension were actively actuated by the SEAs while abduction\/adduction were passive. A robotic hip exoskeleton was developed by Chen et al [10] to support lift movement assistance of heavy tasks with hip flexion and extension movements, which was powered by two SEAs that achieved a peak torque of 22 Nm. Masood et al [11] have developed a robotic exoskeleton with 12 DOFs to assist able-bodied people with manual handling tasks. Only hip flexion and extension were active with an output torque of approximately 53 Nm but a weight of 11.6 kg, which were actuated by two parallel elastic actuators (PEAs). Our previously developed a SEA-driven 4-DOF hip exoskeleton, called NREL-Exo, in which both hip flexion\/extension and hip adduction\/abduction were actively controlled [12]-[14]. While these devices have achieved some level of success, they are restrained by the SEA for a narrow bandwidth and limited stiffness range. Additionally, their bulkiness also limits their application. In this paper, we present a newly developed lightweight, compact, compliant, and modular 2-DOF robotic hip exoskeleton with powered flexion and extension motions.","id":"10daf62f-78b2-41ff-9aaf-195c818d2fbc"}

Asbeck, Stefano Marco Maria De Rossi, Jaehyun Bae, Thiago Ribeiro Teles Santos, Vanessa Lara Araujo, Sangjun Lee, Kenneth G. Holt, Conor Walsh, Member, IEEE  Abstract--- To understand the effects of soft exosuits on human loaded walking, we developed a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide synchronized forces to the ankle and hip joints. Two different assistive strategies were evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.25 m\/s with a 23.8 kg backpack: 1) hip extension assistance and 2) multi-joint assistance (hip extension, ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion). Results show that the exosuit introduces minimum changes to kinematics and reduces biological joint moments. A reduction trend in muscular activity was observed for both conditions. On average, the exosuit reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 0.21 ± 0.04 W\/kg and 0.67 ± 0.09 W\/kg for hip extension assistance and multi-joint assistance respectively, which is equivalent to an average metabolic reduction of 4.6% and 14.6% demonstrating that soft exosuits can effectively improve human walking efficiency during load carriage without affecting natural walking gait. Moreover, it indicates that actuating multiple joints with soft exosuits provides a significant benefit to muscular activity and metabolic cost compared to actuating single joint.

These methods vary from the simplest case of using solely commanded motor torques, to partial consideration of the robot dynamics, to advanced methods considering full robot dynamics such as inverse dynamics (ID) and nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) based algorithms. Dynamic and friction models of the exoskeleton were developed and their parameters were identified using an evolutionary optimization algorithm to ensure high parameter accuracy. When used with accurate model parameters, ID method led to 20 to 22% average error, while NDO method generated 12 to 18% average error, as evaluated in experiments with a force sensor. These values compare to average error values of up to 132% for using motor torques only, and between 25 to 69% when partial dynamics were used. A sensitivity analysis of the ID and NDO methods to inaccuracies in model parameter estimations revealed considerable sensitivity of these advanced methods to model parameter variations. A summary is provided for the typical estimation accuracy levels that can be expected of these methods and discuss the limitations and considerations that should be taken into account for their use.

Approximately 795,000 stroke incidents take place every year, leading to an estimated combined direct and indirect cost of $68.9 billion [30]. With close to 12,000 incidents per year, SCI leads to estimated annual direct and indirect costs of $14.5 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively [6].

Geberth, and Hartmut Geyer  Abstract—Variable swing-leg placement is crucial for robust and stable locomotion. While appropriate leg placement is generated in humanoid robotics by tracking pre-planned swing motions, this approach is not suitable for controlling powered limbs like prostheses, which form only part of the human-robot locomotor system. In recent work, we proposed swing controls for a double pendulum leg model that predicts variable and robust leg placement in the presence of large gait disturbances. Here we evaluate the performance of these novel controls on robotic leg testbeds. In hardware experiments we ﬁnd that the control achieves robust foot placement of anthropomorphic robotic limbs within a range of landing leg angles observed in human gait. We further observe that a version of this control that conforms with the constraints of neuromuscular dynamics generates a more human-like leg behavior at the cost of placement precision. The results suggest that the proposed controls transfer well to robotic limb systems; in particular, they may enable improved balance recovery in amputee locomotion with powered leg prostheses.  Index Terms—Legged Locomotion, Swing-Leg, Humanoid,  Prosthesis, Neuromuscular Control.  I. INTRODUCTION  LEGGED animals and robots use foot placement to bal-  ance dynamically [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. Successful foot placement ﬁrst requires the identiﬁcation of proper placement targets that stabilize locomotion, which can be obtained from simple point mass gait models in walking [6] [7] and run- ning [8] [9]. Once identiﬁed, the second task is the control of the swing-leg into these targets, which is achieved in robotic applications in several ways. Humanoid systems use centralized control strategies that pre-plan and execute full- body trajectories using inverse dynamics and kinematics [10] [11]. These strategies have enabled robots to walk [12], climb stairs [13], and react to push disturbances [14] [15]. However, they are not suited for the control of robotic limbs such as prostheses, where the robot forms only part of the locomoting system.","id":"b706dbf9-f766-43a9-9a2a-a426a0ecac6a"}

Through theoretical analysis with our simpliﬁed system model, we found that the optimal passive stiffness matches the slope of the desired torque-angle relationship. We also conjectured that a bandwidth limit resulted in a maximum rate of change in torque error that can be commanded through control input, which is ﬁxed across desired and passive stiffness conditions. This led to hypotheses about the interactions among optimal control gains, passive stiffness and desired quasi- stiffness. Walking experiments were conducted with multiple angle-based desired torque curves. The observed lowest torque tracking errors identiﬁed for each combination of desired and passive stiffnesses were shown to be linearly proportional to the magnitude of the difference between the two stiffnesses. The proportional gains corresponding to the lowest observed errors were seen inversely proportional to passive stiffness values and to desired stiffness. These ﬁndings supported our hypotheses, and provide guidance to application-speciﬁc hardware customization as well as controller design for torque-controlled robotic legged locomotion.","id":"2157db61-aa36-4656-875c-8bd68f884056"}

Bartlett, J. Alex Heller, Mozziyar Etemadi, Aaron Young, Thomas Pl¨otz, and Omer T. Inan, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Objective: To estimate instantaneous oxygen uptake (VO2) with a small, low-cost wearable sensor during exercise and daily activities in order to enable monitoring of energy expenditure (EE) in uncontrolled settings. We aim to do so using a combination of seismocardiogram (SCG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and atmospheric pressure (AP) signals obtained from a minimally obtrusive wearable device. Methods: In this study, sub- jects performed a treadmill protocol in a controlled environment and an outside walking protocol in an uncontrolled environment. During testing, the COSMED K5 metabolic system collected gold standard breath-by-breath (BxB) data and a custom-built wearable patch placed on the mid-sternum collected SCG, ECG and AP signals. We extracted features from these signals to estimate the BxB VO2 data obtained from the COSMED system. Results: In estimating instantaneous VO2, we achieved our best results on the treadmill protocol using a combination of SCG (frequency) and AP features (RMSE of 3.68±0.98 ml\/kg\/min and R2 of 0.77). For the outside protocol, we achieved our best results using a combination of SCG (frequency), ECG and AP features (RMSE of 4.3±1.47 ml\/kg\/min and R2 of 0.64). In estimating VO2 consumed over one minute intervals during the protocols, our median percentage error was 15.8% for the treadmill protocol and 20.5% for the outside protocol. Conclusion: SCG, ECG and AP signals from a small wearable patch can enable accurate estimation of instantaneous VO2 in both controlled and uncontrolled settings. SCG signals capturing variation in cardio-mechanical processes, AP signals, and state of the art machine learning models contribute signiﬁcantly to the accurate estimation of instantaneous VO2. Signiﬁcance: Accurate estimation of VO2 with a low cost, minimally obtrusive wearable patch can enable the monitoring of VO2 and EE in everyday settings and make the many applications of these measurements more accessible to the general public.","id":"a756aa04-61d9-4a28-bb0b-b8174c86d9ce"}

Without expert guidance, people can even increase the risk of injury by choosing a comfortable posture rather than the appropriate one, notably when lifting objects. Even in situations where squatting is accepted as a desirable lifting strategy, people tend to choose the more comfortable strategy of stooping or semisquatting. The common approach to correcting lifting posture, immobilizing vulnerable joints via fixation, is insufficient for preventing back injuries sustained from repetitive lifting. Instead, when lifting small but heavy objects, the entire kinetic chain should cooperate to achieve a series of squat-lifting patterns. Inspired by the observation that force fields affect the coordination of voluntary human motion, we devised a passive exosuit embedded with a body-powered variable-impedance mechanism. The exosuit adds impedance to the human joints according to how far the wearer’s movement is from the squat-lifting trajectories so that it hinders stooping but facilitates squatting. In an experiment that entailed lifting a small 10-kg box, 10 first-time users changed their voluntary lifting motion closer to squatting on average. Simulation results based on recorded kinematic and kinetic data showed that this postural change reduced the compression force, shear force, and moment on the lumbosacral joint. Our work demonstrates the potential of using an exosuit to help people move in a desirable manner without requiring a complicated, bulky mechanical system.","id":"e077098a-f86a-423a-bb66-1020da1648cc"}

A human augmentation approach based on the application of bio- mechatronics and artificial intelligence, and referred to as the “Dermoskeleton” concept or Knee Stress Release Device (KSRD™), aims to address the distributed weight overload challenge. This device attaches to the outer sections of both legs and provides assistance during walking. This report describes a user evaluation of the KSRD™ beta version using regular force members of the Canadian Forces. Results suggest that the KSRD™ beta version performance improves as more load is added onto the soldier. The addition of the KSRD™ beta version produced similar physiological effects as adding weight to the participants’ total load. Several recommendations are provided with respect to future studies involving future versions of the KSRD™.  INTRODUCTION The typical weight burden of dismounted soldiers  often exceeds 40 kg, i.e. more than 50% of the body weight, which is much beyond the recommended human factor safe load limits (Bedard, Tack, Pageau, Ricard, and Rittenhouse, 2011). This produces a significant strain on the musculoskeletal system in order to transport these loads over long distances. During a three year period from January 2004 to December 2007, of all the medical evacuations from both Iraq and Afghanistan, 31% were due to musculoskeletal, connective tissue, or spinal cord injuries, which excessive weight carried by soldiers is a contributing factor. Of these injuries, more than 80% of the soldiers never returned to combat (Bernton, 2011).","id":"3920859c-d009-4edc-8c8b-8d67f110d4b0"}

The strategy was designed with an auto- matic training algorithm which could update the classiﬁers with the data of the most recent completed gait cycles to seize the changes of the features brought by external disturbances. After implementation, we measured multiple experimental sessions on six transtibial amputees with intervals from a few hours (inter-session experiment) to several months (108 days at most in inter-day experiment). In each session,they performed ﬁve locomotion modes and eight locomotion transitions using the robotic prosthesis. Between each two experimental sessions, the subjects were required to doff the robotic prosthesis (including the socket).

This work aimed to investigate energetic adaptations occurring over multiple training sessions, while walking with a soft exosuit assisting the hip joint. The participants attended five training sessions within 20 days. They walked carrying a load of 20.4 kg for 20 minutes with the exosuit powered and five minutes with the exosuit unpowered. Percentage change in net metabolic cost between the powered and unpowered conditions improved across sessions from −6.2 ± 3.9% (session one) to −10.3 ± 4.7% (session five), indicating a significant effect associated with training. The percentage change at session three (−10.5 ± 4.5%) was similar to the percentage change at session five, indicating that two 20-minute sessions may be sufficient for users to fully adapt and maximize the metabolic benefit provided by the exoskeleton. Retention was also tested measuring the metabolic reduction five months after the last training session. The percent change in metabolic cost during this session (−10.1 ± 3.2%) was similar to the last training session, indicating that the adaptations resulting in reduced metabolic cost are preserved. These outcomes are relevant when evaluating exoskeletons’ performance on naïve users, with a specific focus on hip extension assistance.","id":"f32f524b-bd38-4716-9ff9-9630395f0810"}

INTRODUCTION  O NE in eight adults in the U.S. has a mobility impairment  thatlimitstheirsocialactivity,economicproductivity,and quality of life [1]. These deﬁcits often stem from advanced age, stroke, or musculoskeletal disorders. Most of these indi- viduals have some voluntary control of their lower limbs, and thus require only partial assistance to overcome these deﬁcits. However, no broadly applicable intervention ﬁts this important need [2]. Conventional orthoses tend to immobilize rather than assist joints, causing side-effects that include compensatory  movements,gaitasymmetry,andoverdependence onthedevice. In addition, most mobility aids (e.g., passive orthoses, canes, and walkers) cannot provide net-positive mechanical work to assist activities that require substantial muscular effort, includ- ing squatting, sit-to-stand, and stair ascent.","id":"ac6bd1bf-998a-4b83-859e-03d3a043b082"}

Azocar, Student Member, IEEE and Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE    Abstract—Objective: Recently, human joint impedance—the instantaneous mechanical response to a perturbation—has been quantified during gait, providing new insight beyond the traditional biomechanical descriptions of kinetics and kinematics. However, the role of joint impedance in neuromotor control and the development of exoskeletons and other wearable robotic systems remains unknown. One approach to studying the role of impedance in neuromotor control involves characterizing the human ability to discriminate changes in external impedance properties. Thus, the purpose of this work is to quantify the minimum detectable change in the stiffness component of interacting with an external mechanical impedance when impedance at the human ankle or knee. Methods: A dynamometer coupled to subjects’ right ankle or knee rendered the dynamics of a virtual rotational spring-damper system. The minimum detectable change, or just noticeable difference, was determined via a weighted up-down staircase method in which subjects compared the stiffness values of two different controller configurations. Results: We found that subjects could reliably detect stiffness changes of at least 12% at the ankle and 13% at the knee. Conclusion: Stiffness errors or variations produced by an external mechanical device will be undetected if they remain below the 12% to 13% threshold. Significance: Our results provide novel insight into how the sensorimotor system senses joint impedance, information which may improve the design and control of impedance-based wearable robotic technologies.","id":"3361267d-2a87-4483-8231-ff05c76d93e2"}

The following research discusses the posthuman subject in contemporary times, focusing on prosthetic applications to deliberate how the disabled body is empowered through prosthetic enhancement and cultural representations. The disability market both intersects and transcends race, religion, and gender; the promise of technology bettering the human condition is its ultimate product. Bionic technology, in particular, is a burgeoning ﬁeld; our engineering skills already show promise of a future where physical impediment will be almost obsolete. I aim to cross-examine empowering marketing images and phrases embedded in cinema and media that emphasize how disability becomes super-ability with prosthetic enhancement. Though the beneﬁts of biotechnology are most empowering to the disabled population, further scrutiny raises a number of paradoxical questions exposed by the market’s advance. With all these tools at our disposal, why is it that the disabled have yet to reap the rewards? How are disabled bodies, biotechnology, and posthuman possibilities commodiﬁed and commercialized? Most importantly, what impact will this have on our society? This paper exempliﬁes empowering and inclusive messages emphasized in disabled representation, as well as raising bioethical concerns that fuel the ongoing debate of the technological haves and have-nots. Furthermore, this paper challenges the ideals of normative bodies while depicting the disabledasanopen, embodiedsitewheretechnology, corporeality, andsociologyinteract. Toconclude, I believe that an interdisciplinary approach that balances the debate between scientiﬁc advance, capital gain, and social equality is essential to embracing diverse forms of embodiment.

Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity.

Lerner  1,2, Diane L. Damiano1 & Thomas C. Bulea 1  Individuals with cerebral palsy often exhibit crouch gait, a debilitating and inefficient walking pattern marked by excessive knee flexion that worsens with age. To address the need for improved treatment, we sought to evaluate if providing external knee extension assistance could reduce the excessive burden placed on the knee extensor muscles as measured by knee moments. We evaluated a novel pediatric exoskeleton designed to provide appropriately-timed extensor torque to the knee joint during walking in a multi-week exploratory clinical study. Seven individuals (5–19 years) with mild-moderate crouch gait from cerebral palsy (GMFCS I-II) completed the study. For six participants, powered knee extension assistance favorably reduced the excessive stance-phase knee extensor moment present during crouch gait by a mean of 35% in early stance and 76% in late stance. Peak stance-phase knee and hip extension increased by 12° and 8°, respectively. Knee extensor muscle activity decreased slightly during exoskeleton-assisted walking compared to baseline, while knee flexor activity was elevated in some participants. These findings support the use of wearable exoskeletons for the management of crouch gait and provide insights into their future implementation.  Many individuals with cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent cause of physical disability in childhood1, present an increasingly flexed or “crouched” gait pattern throughout the lifespan2. This pathological gait pattern, known as crouch gait, increases the metabolic cost of transport3 and is associated with knee pain and degradation due to elevated joint loads4. Despite efforts to manage crouch gait surgically5,6 and with physical therapy7, walking defi- cits generally remain after treatment such that approximately 50% of affected individuals lose the ability to walk independently in adulthood8. Effective gait rehabilitation remains a major clinical challenge in CP9.","id":"c3c0cfb2-602f-4a4b-8908-b8b2c7ba9daa"}

Understanding the physiological origin of these features is essential for enhancing the mobility of elderly people.  Despite previous efforts, the origin of both increased energetic cost (15-30% for the ages of 70-90, Fig-A, [1]) and slower preferred walking speed (0.2-0.5 ms-1 for the same ages) remains obscure. For example, it has been shown that none of the basal metabolism, mechanical work, and stability measures explain this inefficiency of elderly walking. Similarly, the cost of transport (CoT, metabolic energy cost per walking distance), a widely used criterion for preferred walking speed of animals, do not explain the slower preferred walking speed of elderlies, since the CoT- speed curve of elderlies does not shift towards slower speed (Fig-A). Identifying the origin of elderly gait remains a challenging problem, since it is difficult to control each physiological properties independently as all changes occur simultaneously along aging.  investigate the contribution of physiological changes to elderly gait in simulation.  Main Results We find that, as observed in elderly gait, the model simulating the common physiological changes shows an increased CoT (16%, Fig-B). However, optimizing for CoT does not suggest a slower preferred walking speed. Instead, we find that a slower preferred speed (by about 0.25 ms-1) in line with experimental observations emerges if the model is optimized for fatigue of transport (FoT, muscle fatigue per walking distance, Fig-C) or stress of transport (SoT, muscle stress per walking distance, Fig-D).  Our detailed model analysis of the contributing physiological changes further suggests that both the metabolic cost increase and the slower walking speed are mainly related to a reduction in muscle strength and mass in the elderly population. We also discuss the effect of other physiological changes and potential ramifications of these findings for improving mobility in elderlies.","id":"47ec1ba4-12ee-40e9-ab27-ab46ae242f22"}

It is designed to capture and store 20% of the biomechanical energy dissipated at the biological knee joint during decent phase and return the harnessed energy in the ascent phase in a squatting cycle. The effectiveness of the proposed system was verified by evaluating performance of key muscles of knee joint using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. Statistical data from experiments revealed a reduction of peak root-mean-square averages of sEMG signals of knee extensor muscles by 30 - 40% during squatting.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  The game of curling can be considered a good test bed for studying the interaction between artificial intelligence systems and the real world. In curling, the environmental characteristics change at every moment, and every throw has an impact on the outcome of the match. Furthermore, there is no time for relearning during a curling match due to the timing rules of the game. Here, we report a curling robot that can achieve human-level performance in the game of curling using an adaptive deep reinforcement learning framework. Our proposed adaptation framework extends standard deep reinforcement learning using temporal features, which learn to compensate for the uncer- tainties and nonstationarities that are an unavoidable part of curling. Our curling robot, Curly, was able to win three of four official matches against expert human teams [top-ranked women’s curling teams and Korea national wheelchair curling team (reserve team)]. These results indicate that the gap between physics-based simulators and the real world can be narrowed.  INTRODUCTION Applying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to the real world (1–7) is a challenging problem. Operating beyond the confines of a laboratory means dealing with unknown factors, such as an environ- ment that varies over time, that can have an effect on the performance of an AI system (8, 9). Moreover, the real world offers many uncer- tainties, which may be too complex and ill defined to be modeled with sufficient accuracy (10). Thus, it is necessary to incorporate uncertainty into modeling efforts and to measure and approximate changes in real-world environments (5–7).","id":"629a3a53-7479-4db0-855c-4e527ba5d541"}

However, EMG is a noisy signal which can vary over time, giving rise to the question what approach for knee torque estimation is most suitable for multi-day control. In this study we compared three different modelling frameworks to estimate knee torque in non-weight-bearing situations. The ﬁrst model contained a convolutional neural network (CNN) which mapped EMG to knee torque directly. The second used a neuromusculoskeletal model (NMS) which used EMG, muscle tendon unit lengths and moment arms to compute knee torque. The third model (Hybrid) used a CNN to map EMG to speciﬁc muscle activation, which was used together with NMS components to compute knee torque. Multi-day measurements were conducted on ten able-bodied participants who performed non-weight bearing activities. CNN had the best performance in general and on each day (Normalized Root Mean Squared (NRMSE 12.4 ± 3.4%) was able to Error (NRMSE) 9.2 ± 4.4%). The Hybrid model outperform NMS (NRMSE 14.3 ± 4.2%). The NMS model showed no signiﬁcant difference between measurement days. The CNN model and Hybrid models had signiﬁcant performance differences between the ﬁrst day and all other days. CNNs are suited for multi-day torque estimation in terms of error rate, outperforming the other two model types. NMS was the only model type which was robust over all days. This study investigated the behavior of three model types over multiple days, giving insight in the most suited modelling approach for multi-day torque estimation to be used in prosthetic control.","id":"0191015a-3713-4073-9228-415f26311aa0"}

However, the lack of sufﬁcient labeled training samples is a huge challenge for HSI classiﬁcation. To face this challenge, we propose a semisu- pervised HSI classiﬁcation method based on graph convolutional broad network (GCBN). First, to avoid the underﬁtting problem caused by the insufﬁcient linear sparse feature representation abil- ity of broad learning system (BLS), graph convolution operation is applied to extract nonlinear and discriminative spectral-spatial features from the original HSI to replace the linear mapping features in the traditional BLS. Second, to solve the problem of insufﬁcient model classiﬁcation ability caused by limited labeled samples, the combinatorial average method (CAM) is proposed to use valuable paired samples to generate sample expansion set for GCBNmodeltraining.Third,BLSisusedtoperformbroadexpan- sion on spectral-spatial features extracted by GCN and extended byCAM,whichfurtherenhancesthefeaturerepresentationability.

Abstract  Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically asymmetric and metabolically expensive. Weakness  and impaired control of the paretic ankle contribute to reduced forward propulsion and ground clearance—  walking subtasks critical for safe and efficient locomotion. Targeted gait interventions that improve paretic  ankle function after stroke are therefore warranted. We have developed textile-based, soft wearable robots  that transmit mechanical power generated by off-board or body-worn actuators to the paretic ankle using  Bowden cables (soft exosuits) and have demonstrated the exosuits can overcome deficits in paretic limb  forward propulsion and ground clearance, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking.  This study elucidates the biomechanical mechanisms underlying exosuit-induced reductions in metabolic  power. We evaluated the relationships between exosuit-induced changes in the body center of mass (COM)  power generated by each limb, individual joint powers, and metabolic power. Compared to walking with  an exosuit unpowered, exosuit assistance produced more symmetrical COM power generation during the  critical period of the step-to-step transition (22.4±6.4% more symmetric).

Therefore, the purpose of this article is 2-fold: ﬁrst, to examine kinematics and kinetics of the dynamic squat with respect to the ankle, knee, hip and spinal joints and, second, to provide recommendations based on these bio- mechanical factors for optimizing exercise performance.

Given that most activities of daily living necessitate the simultaneous coordinated interaction of numerous muscle groups, the squat is considered one of the best exercises for improving quality of life because of its ability to recruit multiple muscle groups in a single maneuver (22). The squatting movement has close speciﬁcity to many everyday tasks (such as lifting packages and picking up children), as well as having an indirect correlation to count- less other chores and hobbies.  The squat also is becoming increasingly popular in clinical settings as a means to strengthen lower-body muscles and connective tissue after joint-related injury. It has been used extensively for therapeutic treatment of ligament lesions, patellofemoral dysfunctions, total joint replacement, and ankle instability (14,56). Moreover, the closed-chain stance required for performance reduces anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strain (64), making it superior to the knee extension for rehabilitation of ACL injury (21,65).","id":"b78970cd-97cc-4ef6-865a-24e29bc484d3"}

We recapitulate a control framework for Lagrangian hybrid systems, and show that regulat- ing a state varying energy function is equivalent to applying energy shaping and regulat- ing the system to a constant energy value. We then consider a simple one-dimensional hopping robot and show how energy shaping and regulation control can be used to gen- erate and transition between nearly globally stable hopping limit cycles. The principles from this example are then applied on two canonical walking models, the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) and compass gait biped, to generate and transition between locomotive gaits.

In this paper, a human-robot cooperation control method using compliance factor with feedback torque and adjustable stiffness is proposed, which can arbitrarily change the current motion trajectory according to the user's active intention torque, while the knee exoskeleton can maintain the compliance and stability of the motion. The compliance factor includes stiffness adjustment items and torque adjustment items. The stiffness change feedback based on SEA improves the flexibility. The intention amplification function is designed to enhance the user's active intention. The proposed method is validated by the designed knee exoskeleton. When feedback compliance factor, knee exoskeleton has good compliance and flexibility.

INTRODUCTION Wearable lower limb exoskeleton robots have been developed to assist in treating stroke and other diseases, enhance human strength, or supplement human capabilities [1], [2], [3]. A variety of assisted exoskeleton robots have been developed to help humans complete the desired motions and tasks [4], [5]. The exoskeleton robot has direct physical interaction with human work, so human-robot interaction (human-robot interaction) or human-robot cooperation has become a hot field in robotics [6], [7]. In order to achieve seamless and intuitive human-robot cooperation, an important task is to let robots understand human intentions. Predefined motions cannot meet the control requirements of human-machine collaboration, and researchers have developed control methods based on human intention feedback [8], [9]. A way to directly obtain the information of human robot interaction status, the interactive force\/torque sensor has the advantages of convenient installation, stable data transmission, low cost, and is easier to be integrated into the robot.

Linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were used for calibration, and 10-fold cross-validation was applied to estimate the system’s accuracy. Results indicate that machine learning regression methods may lead to improved accuracy, but the choice of the kernel function is critical.

IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS  Design and Control of a Novel Active Shoulder Exoskeleton for Overhead Work Assistance  Shuo Ding , Ashwin Narayan , Associate Member, IEEE, Francisco Anaya Reyes , Shuishuai Han , and Haoyong Yu , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—This article presents a novel active shoulder exoskeleton to assist overhead work. The exoskeleton has its actuators, control electronics, and the battery packed in a drive unit located on the user’s back. Bowden cables are used to transmit the forces from the drive unit to the shoulder joints of two lightweight arm support structures. Due to the ﬂexibility of the Bowden cable, the exoskeleton can adapt to complex shoulder joint movements. Linear series elastic actuators are used to achieve force control instead of position control for overhead work assistance. The design speciﬁcations achieve a portable and compliant system. In addition, a multimodal assistive strategy has been developed to handle different working conditions with seamless switching between different modes: free mode with zero torque tracking when no assistance is needed, assist mode during overhead work, and safe mode when a sudden impact load is detected. Experimental studies conducted in simulated overhead work conditions demon- strated the usability and effectiveness of the system. Sta- tistical analysis of the electromyography signals from the key shoulder muscles indicated that the exoskeleton could reduce the level of shoulder muscle activation by up to 40%.

Tommaso Ranzani, Sheila Russo, & Conor Walsh School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA  ABSTRACT  Recently, there has been a growing interest in moving away from traditional rigid exoskeletons towards soft exosuits that can provide a variety of advantages including a reduction in both the weight carried by the wearer and the inertia experienced as the wearer flexes and extends their joints. These advantages are achieved by using structured functional textiles in combination with a flexible actuation scheme that enables assistive torques to be applied to the biological joints. Understanding the human- suit interface in these systems is important, as one of the key challenges with this approach is applying force to the human body in a manner that is safe, comfortable, and effective. This paper outlines a methodology for characterizing the structured functional textile of soft exosuits and then uses that methodology to evaluate several factors that lead to different suit-human series stiffnesses and pressure distributions over the body. These factors include the size of the force distribution area and the composition of the structured functional textile. Following the test results, design guidelines are suggested to maximize the safety, comfort, and efficiency of the exosuit.  INTRODUCTION  FIGURE 1.

INTRODUCTION  E LECTRO mechanical wearable exoskeletons are designed  to assist human motion and mobility in numerous contexts [1]. Exoskeletons were ﬁrst developed in the 1960s and are used today to increase the weight-bearing capacity [2] of individuals with disabilities [3], lower energy expenditure when walking [4], [5] and running [6], [7], [8], harvest energy while walking [9], [10], [11], increase jump height [12], and other uses.  fatigue over extended periods of time. Passive exoskeletons use mechanical components such as springs and dampers to provide assistance without an external power source. This typically makes them lightweight and energy-efﬁcient and better suited for prolonged use [4]. Unfortunately, most current-day passive exoskeletons tend to be tailored to a speciﬁc task (e.g., walking at a given speed).","id":"7e012f2d-d50d-40dc-921f-dc167fdd1ce3"}

The SA knee relies on passive stability to provide support during the stance phase of walking and incorporates a small motor and battery to actively assist the knee motion during the swing phase. A prototype SA knee was constructed and experimentally evaluated on a single transfemoral amputee. The experiments consisted of treadmill walking at three speeds, first on a daily-use passive prosthesis and subsequently on the SA prosthesis prototype, while recording motion capture and ground reaction force data from which prosthesis knee kinematics and affected-side hip torque were computed. A comparison of the passive daily-use prosthesis and the SA prosthesis indicates that the SA prosthesis provides more consistent and repeatable knee motion and reduces pre-swing peak hip torque across all walking speeds. I. INTRODUCTION There are approximately 600,000 persons living in the US with major lower limb amputation, approximately half of whom have transfemoral amputation (TFA) [1]. The worldwide prevalence of TFA is approximately 20-30 times the US prevalence [2]. Multiple types of knee prostheses exist to help restore legged mobility to individuals with TFA [3]. The two primary functions of a knee prosthesis are to provide support (called stance control) during the stance phase of walking and to provide appropriate motion during the swing phase. Traditional passive prostheses typically provide stance phase stability via a hyperextension stop which is engaged by a combination of hip torque and ground reaction force. In some passive prostheses, knee stability during stance is further supplemented by the introduction of stance phase damping, either engaged by microprocessor control (e.g., C-leg) or by mechanical sensing of stance phase (e.g., Mauch knee). The essential aspects of swing phase are sufficient knee flexion to assure toe clearance (i.e., to avoid scuffing the ground during swing) and subsequent sufficient knee extension, which is necessary to achieve knee stability for the following stance phase. Passive knee prostheses achieve swing-phase motion by providing a low resistance which, when combined with the (active) swing phase movement of the residual thigh, in combination with the inertial properties of the lower leg, results in an initial swing-phase knee flexion, followed by knee extension. In some microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs), swing knee resistance is modulated as a function of walking cadence.

Ten normal subjects ascended and descended a ﬁve-step staircase at three different inclinations (24°, 30°, 42°). Three steps were instrumented with force sensors and provided 6 dof ground reactions. Kinematics was analysed by a camera-based optoelectronic system. An inverse dynamics approach was applied to compute joint moments and powers. The different kinematic and kinetic patterns of stair ascent and descent were analysed and compared to level walking patterns. Temporal gait cycle parameters and ground reactions were not signiﬁcantly affected by staircase inclination. Joint angles and moments showed a relatively low but signiﬁcant dependency on the inclination. A large inﬂuence was observed in joint powers. This can be related to the varying amount of potential energy that has to be produced (during ascent) or absorbed (during descent) by the muscles. The kinematics and kinetics of staircase walking differ considerably from level walking. Interestingly, no deﬁnite signs could be found indicating that there is an adaptation or shift in the motor patterns when moving from level to stair walking. This can be clearly seen in the foot placement: compared to level walking, the forefoot strikes the ground ﬁrst—independent from climbing direction and inclination. This and further ﬁndings suggest that there is a certain inclination angle or angular range where subjects do switch between a level walking and a stair walking gait pattern. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Rather than exclu- sively utilizing electromyogram (EMG) for the control of all myoelectric components (e.g., a hand and a wrist), the proposed controller utilizes inertial measurement (from six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU)) to sense upper arm abduction\/adduction, and uses this input to command a wrist rotation velocity. As such, the controller essen- tially substitutes shoulder abduction\/adduction in place of agonist\/antagonist EMG to control wrist angular velocity, which preserves EMG for control of the hand (or other arm components). As a preliminary assessment of efﬁcacy, the control method was implemented on a transradial prosthe- sis prototype with a powered wrist rotator and hand, and experimentally assessed on ﬁve able-bodied subjects who wore the prototype using an able-bodied adaptor and one transradial amputee subject while performing assessments representative of activities of daily living. The assessments compared the (timed) performance of the combined EMG\/ IMU-based control method with a (conventional) sequential EMG control approach.

The proposed hybrid knee uses a spring-damper system in combination with an electric motor and transmission system, which can be engaged to provide a stair ambulation capability. In comparison to fully powered pros- theses that power all ambulation activities, a hybrid knee prosthesis can achieve significant weight reduction by focusing the design of the actuator on a subset of activities without losing the ability to produce equivalent torque and mechanical power in the active mode. The hybrid knee prototype weighs 1.7 kg, including battery and control, and can provide up to 125 Nm of repetitive torque. Experiments with two transfemoral amputee subjects show that the proposed hybrid knee prosthesis can support walking on level ground in the passive mode, as well as stair ambulation with a reciprocal gait pattern in the active mode.

Introduction  Lower-limb amputation affects the ambulation abilities and quality of life of roughly 600,000 individuals in the USA alone (Adams et al., 1999). By 2050, the number of ampu- tees is expected to more than double, mainly due to the pre- valence of peripheral vascular disease (Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008). Individuals with a transfemoral amputation typically walk slower, expend more energy, and have a higher fall risk than able-bodied individuals (Schmalz et al., 2002). Furthermore, ambulation activities, such as climbing ramps and stairs or standing up from a seated position, are much more difficult for amputees than for able-bodied indi- viduals. Therefore, advances in prosthetic technologies are needed to improve the ability of individuals to ambulate after above-knee amputation.","id":"81dca35b-e009-455b-8f8a-557df3885939"}

Huang* and Arthur D. Kuo  to greater metabolic energy expenditure. This underscores the need for a mechanistic explanation for the metabolic cost of walking as a function of load.  ABSTRACT Although humans clearly expend more energy to walk with an extra load, it is unclear what biomechanical mechanisms contribute to that increase. One possible contribution is the mechanical work performed on the body center of mass (COM), which simple models predict should increase linearly with added mass. The work should be performed primarily by the lower extremity joints, although in unknown distribution, and cost a proportionate amount of metabolic energy. We therefore tested normal adults (N=8) walking at constant speed (1.25 m s−1) with varying backpack loads up to 40% of body weight. We measured mechanical work (both performed on the COM and joint work from inverse dynamics), as well as metabolic energy expenditure through respirometry. Both measures of work were found to increase approximately linearly with carried load, with COM work rate increasing by approximately 1.40 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The joints all contributed work, but the greatest increase in positive work was attributable to the ankle during push-off (45–60% of stride time) and the knee in the rebound after collision (12–30% stride). The hip performed increasing amounts of negative work, near the end of stance. Rate of metabolic energy expenditure also increased approximately linearly with load, by approximately 7.6 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The ratio of the increases in work and metabolic cost yielded a relatively constant efficiency of approximately 16%. The metabolic cost not explained by work appeared to be relatively constant with load and did not exhibit a particular trend. Most of the increasing cost for carrying a load appears to be explained by positive mechanical work, especially about the ankle and knee, with both work and metabolic cost increasing nearly linearly with added mass.","id":"6c4cdecc-424a-46d3-97c8-949e0fbbaac1"}

Subjects walked with a backpack loaded and unloaded, on a treadmill with inclinations of 0° and 15°, and outdoors with varied natural terrain. Participants walked at a self-selected speed (average 1.0 m\/s) for all conditions, except incline treadmill walking (average 0.5 m\/s).

All other conditions had an increase in metabolic cost when using the knee exoskeleton compared with not using the exoskeleton. There was more variation in metabolic cost over the outdoor walking course with the knee exoskeleton than without it. Our ﬁndings indicate that powered assistance at the knee is more likely to decrease the metabolic cost of walking in uphill conditions and during loaded walking rather than in level conditions without a backpack load.

For this time-invariant ESC, we propose a method to prove the closed loop system has an asymptotically stable limit cycle. The method is based on a perturbation theorem for maps, and, unlike existing techniques that use averaging and singular perturbation tools, it is not limited to weakly nonlinear systems. We use a typical example system to show that our method does indeed establish asymptotic stability of the limit cycle with minimal amplitude.

However, there are applications where the plant does not operate at a ﬁxed time-scale. Human locomotion is one example, which exhibits varying time-scales based on the walking speed) [11]. In a transfemoral powered prosthetic leg, the evolution of the knee and the ankle joints are typically synchronized to an external signal, e.g., the human’s hip signal [12], [13]. In the application of time-based ESC with such periodic systems with varying time-scales, if the desired task results in slow operation speed, then the use of ﬁxed time- based ESC parameters would violate the time-scale separation thus, the ESC adaptation can no longer be guaranteed to be stable [14]. Although newer forms of ESC using high- frequency dither signals can handle varying time-scales [15]– [17], the introduction of fast oscillations in the system might be undesirable for precise trajectory tracking applications.  Limit cycles occur in numerous engineering applications, e.g., tracking error response in rehabilitation robots [1], self- excited vibrations in automotive braking systems [2], oscil- latory wing response in aircraft [3], which can limit the performance and safety of the system. Feedback control can reduce the size of the limit cycle but cannot completely eliminate it. To improve performance, the control requirement is often to enforce a “smallest”, stable limit cycle.","id":"746af1ba-9a55-43bf-9d38-ba029cb23a45"}

Walsh1*  As we age, humans see natural decreases in muscle force and power which leads to a slower, less efficient gait. Improving mobility for both healthy individuals and those with muscle impairments\/ weakness has been a goal for exoskeleton designers for decades. In this work, we discover that significant reductions in the energy cost required for walking can be achieved with almost 50% less mechanical power compared to the state of the art. This was achieved by leveraging human‑in‑ the‑loop optimization to understand the importance of individualized assistance for hip flexion, a relatively unexplored joint motion. Specifically, we show that a tethered hip flexion exosuit can reduce the metabolic rate of walking by up to 15.2 ± 2.6%, compared to locomotion with assistance turned off (equivalent to 14.8% reduction compared to not wearing the exosuit). This large metabolic reduction was achieved with surprisingly low assistance magnitudes (average of 89 N, ~ 24% of normal hip flexion torque). Furthermore, the ratio of metabolic reduction to the positive exosuit power delivered was 1.8 times higher than ratios previously found for hip extension and ankle plantarflexion. These findings motivated the design of a lightweight (2.31 kg) and portable hip flexion assisting exosuit, that demonstrated a 7.2 ± 2.9% metabolic reduction compared to walking without the exosuit. The high ratio of metabolic reduction to exosuit power measured in this study supports previous simulation findings and provides compelling evidence that hip flexion may be an efficient joint motion to target when considering how to create practical and lightweight wearable robots to support improved mobility.","id":"c258daa5-aa7e-40a7-9db4-3521054bfa09"}

WRAPS can modulate the displacement of the upper ring and\/or the forces applied on the torso through the ring in four degrees-of-freedom (DOF), including rotations and translation in the sagittal and frontal planes.  In the present study, we evaluate the design of WRAPS and its functions. Moreover, we discuss the potential effectiveness of WRAPS as a therapeutic robotic tool in people with severe trunk con- trol deﬁcits. The performance of WRAPS was evaluated in seated healthy subjects. Kinematics and surface electromyography (sEMG) were collected when the participants performed selective trunk movements. First, the torso range of motion (tROM) was calculated with WRAPS in transparent mode—zero-force control mode—which was compared with free-guided tROM (no WRAPS) with motion capture system. Second, a position control mode was conﬁgured to mobilize the torso along the trajectories obtained with the transparent mode.","id":"d81169a7-26ac-4d00-81ec-0d4f54a8ee33"}

In addition to walking on ﬂat terrain, the y are evolving to handle advanced scenarios such as stairs, allowing for a wider range of activities.

Two kinds of numerical simulations and real exoskeleton experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively and safely generate the trajectories to as- sist users in ascending stairs. Additionally, the effectiveness of the exoskeleton’s assistance is veriﬁed through a comparison of electromyography (EMG) signals from seven muscles.

INTRODUCTION  A CCORDINGtotheWorldHealthOrganization,morethan  70 million people currently suffer from different kinds of mobility disorders [1]. To assist patients to regain locomotion ability in daily life, several powered lower-limb exoskeletons have been developed, including commercial exoskeletons [2], [3], [4] and research prototypes [5], [6], [7]. These active wear- able robots allow humans to overcome their physical limitations by providing additive joint power.

In this article, several deep variants of BLS are reviewed, and a new adaptive incremen- tal structure, Stacked BLS, is proposed. The proposed model is a novel incremental stacking of BLS. This invariant inherits the efﬁciency and effectiveness of BLS that the structure and weights of lower layers of BLS are ﬁxed when the new blocks are added. The incremental stacking algorithm computes not only the con- nection weights between the newly stacking blocks but also the connection weights of the enhancement nodes within the BLS block. The Stacked BLS is considered as the increment of “layers” and “neurons” dynamically during the training for multilayer neural networks. The proposed architecture along with the training algorithms that utilizes the residual characteristic is very versatile in comparison with traditional ﬁxed architecture. Finally, experimental results on UCI datasets, MNIST dataset, NORB dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, SVHN dataset, and CIFAR- 100 dataset indicate that the proposed method outperforms the selected state-of-the-art methods on both accuracy and training speed, such as deep residual networks.

The device is comprised of a high-pressure air tank, a pilot-operated valve, and a nozzle, which are employed together to create a thrust intended to correct a state of imbalance. The authors first employed modeling and simulation of the thruster-based system to assess feasibility of such a device, and based on these results designed and constructed a device prototype. The prototype was then tested on a rocking block that was used as an experimental model of a standing human subject. Experiments were conducted to assess the angular response of the rocking block starting from various initial tilt angles, both with and without the use of the cold gas thruster. For the experiments with the thruster, the valve was energized at the moment of release, thereby activating the cold-gas thruster, the thrust of which was directed to oppose the “fall.” A comparison between the two cases indicates that the fall prevention prototype increased the region of block stability by more than a factor of three (from a tilt angle of approximately 7 to 26 deg). I. INTRODUCTION Falls in elderly people are a well-known cause of injury. One in four people over the age of 65 fall every year costing an estimated $31.3 billion to Medicare annually [1]. As people age, their balance declines due to several physiological changes. In particular, balance depends on visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and musculoskeletal systems, all of which are subject to become compromised as age advances [2]. Falls can lead to severe injuries, fear of falling, loss of independence and death [3]. The majority of fall prevention research has focused on in-home strategies for preventing falls, such as handrails, higher friction flooring, and improved lighting. However, an epidemiological study of falls in older community-dwellings showed that 62% of falls occur while outside of the home [4]. A significant unmet need exists for a device to prevent falls outside of the home without a large impact on the user’s lifestyle. The recent emergence of wearable devices may offer promise to aid fall prevention. At this point, relatively little research exists on the use of wearable devices for fall prevention","id":"e83f15b1-553d-4c02-a809-9a93f18619f1"}

Nuckols, Krithika Swaminathan, Sangjun Lee, Dheepak Arumukhom Revi, Conor J. Walsh, and Robert D. Howe  Paulson School of Engineering and the Wyss Institute at Harvard, MA, USA.  Abstract—Wearable robotic devices (exosuits, exoskeletons) for augmenting gait can reduce group level metabolic demand. However, at the individual level, metabolic response is variable and the mechanisms behind this inconsistency is unclear. In this work, our aim is to investigate the effect of muscle tendon dynamics on individual response to exosuit assistance. To this end, we measured muscle contraction state of the soleus and medial gastrocnemius using B-mode ultrasound while naïve subjects walked with exosuit assistance. We also sub-categorized subjects into good and poor responders. We found that subjects that responded well (15% reduction) to the assistance began soleus muscle contraction prior to the onset of assistance. Conversely, the soleus muscle contraction began after the onset of assistance in subjects that responded poorly (2% reduction). We also found that the medial gastrocnemius was lengthening at the time of assistance onset in subjects that responded poorly which may highlight the impact of knee mechanics. These findings suggest the importance of energy exchange between the muscle, tendon, joint and environment towards efficient walking and how exosuit assistance might affect those dynamics. Ongoing and future work will expand upon this work and will incorporate EMG, kinematic, and kinetic analysis.  Our aim in this work is to evaluate whether muscle contraction dynamics of the triceps surae can help explain individual response to ankle exosuit assistance. The efficiency of walking is heavily reliant upon proper function of the ankle joint and the muscle-tendon unit (MTU). Efficient and powerful ankle plantarflexion is generated only through properly timed energy exchange between the muscle, the series elastic tendon, the joint, body, and environment. Therefore, understanding and maintaining effective MTU dynamics is also crucial for efficient walking. We suggest that ultrasound-based measurement of muscle dynamics can provide for understanding exosuit performance compared to kinematic, kinetic, and EMG-based measurements. We hypothesize that initial response to exosuit assistance will be predicted by similarity between baseline muscle contraction timing and the onset timing of exosuit assistance.  improved metrics  II.

The proposed hybrid knee uses a spring-damper system in combination with an electric motor and transmission system, which can be engaged to provide a stair ambulation capability. In comparison to fully powered pros- theses that power all ambulation activities, a hybrid knee prosthesis can achieve significant weight reduction by focusing the design of the actuator on a subset of activities without losing the ability to produce equivalent torque and mechanical power in the active mode. The hybrid knee prototype weighs 1.7 kg, including battery and control, and can provide up to 125 Nm of repetitive torque.

Introduction  Lower-limb amputation affects the ambulation abilities and quality of life of roughly 600,000 individuals in the USA alone (Adams et al., 1999). By 2050, the number of ampu- tees is expected to more than double, mainly due to the pre- valence of peripheral vascular disease (Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008). Individuals with a transfemoral amputation typically walk slower, expend more energy, and have a higher fall risk than able-bodied individuals (Schmalz et al., 2002). Furthermore, ambulation activities, such as climbing ramps and stairs or standing up from a seated position, are much more difficult for amputees than for able-bodied indi- viduals. Therefore, advances in prosthetic technologies are needed to improve the ability of individuals to ambulate after above-knee amputation.","id":"81dca35b-e009-455b-8f8a-557df3885939"}

The setup of the mechanomyography (MMG) measurement is simpler than the setup for sur- face electromyography (sEMG) measurement and is less affected by sweating. However, torque estimation based on a mechanomyogram involves signiﬁcant noise, which is an important issue. Therefore, we propose a regression analy- sis method to estimate the torque of the knee joint during voluntary movement based on the MMG signal. The pro- posed method differs from conventional methods because it integrates the MMG sensor responses at four locations: anterior, posterior, and medial\/lateral just above the main operating muscle. This method focuses on the acceleration response characteristics, which change slightly depending on the location of the MMG sensor. Support vector regres- sion was performed on the root mean square (RMS) of the MMG signals, which were processed by a low-pass ﬁlter. Two-channel estimation with an increased number of MMG sensors for the leading and antagonist muscles improved the conventional method, and four-channel estimation with medial and lateral sensors further improved the perfor- mance.

In this paper, we propose a myoelectric controller for a robotic transtib- ial prosthesis to realize adaptive slope walking. It works together with the intrinsic controller, enabling amputee users to pay rela- tively less attention on myoelectric control during walking. Am- putee users convey the information of ground slope to prostheses by consciously performing dorsiﬂexion and plantar ﬂexion of the “phantom ankle” with different intensities at the beginning of the swing phase. Two channels of surface electromyographic signals are measured from the residual shank, and they are mapped to the inclination angle of the slope. Control parameters of the in- trinsic controller are then calculated according to the estimated inclination angle. In this preliminary study, two transtibial am- putee subjects were recruited.

INTRODUCTION  E LECTRO mechanical wearable exoskeletons are designed  to assist human motion and mobility in numerous contexts [1]. Exoskeletons were ﬁrst developed in the 1960s and are used today to increase the weight-bearing capacity [2] of individuals with disabilities [3], lower energy expenditure when walking [4], [5] and running [6], [7], [8], harvest energy while walking [9], [10], [11], increase jump height [12], and other uses.  fatigue over extended periods of time. Passive exoskeletons use mechanical components such as springs and dampers to provide assistance without an external power source. This typically makes them lightweight and energy-efﬁcient and better suited for prolonged use [4]. Unfortunately, most current-day passive exoskeletons tend to be tailored to a speciﬁc task (e.g., walking at a given speed).","id":"7e012f2d-d50d-40dc-921f-dc167fdd1ce3"}

Naturally, various forms of upper limb impairments can have a substantial impact on quality of life. We developed the Myoshirt, a textile-based soft wearable robot, or exomuscle, that autonomously follows the user’s movements and thereby assists the shoulder against gravity. With the Myoshirt, participants without impairments (n = 10, 5 male) experienced a delayed onset of muscular fatigue by 51.1 s (36.1%, P < 0.001), while during a functional task their muscular activity decreased by 49.1% (P < 0.001). Analogously, two participants with upper limb impairments due to a muscular dystrophy and a spinal cord injury experienced a delayed onset of muscular fatigue during unloaded arm lifts by 256.4 s (61.5%) and by 450.6 s (210.3%), respectively. Our evidence suggests that the Myoshirt is an effective tool that intuitively assists the shoulder during functional reaching tasks, with the potential of increasing the personal independence of people with upper limb impairments.  Being able to effortlessly perform activities of daily living is  essential to guarantee personal independence. Therefore, naturally, when the function of the arms is impaired due to a  congenital or acquired disorder, quality of life is challenged.

Generalizations can possibly be made to predict gait individuality in unobserved conditions. Methods: Kinematic individuality—how one person’s joint angles differ from the group—is quantiﬁed for every sub- ject, joint, ambulation mode (walking, running, stair ascent, and stair descent), and intramodal task (speed, incline) in an open-access dataset with 10 able-bodied subjects. Four N-way ANOVAs test how prediction methods affect the ﬁt to experimental data between and within ambulation modes. We test whether walking individuality (measured at a single speed on level ground) carries across modes, or whether a mode-speciﬁc prediction (based on a single task for each mode) is signiﬁcantly more effective. Results: Kinematic individualization improves ﬁt across joint and task if we consider each mode separately. Across all modes, tasks, and joints, modal individualization improved the ﬁt in 81% of trials, improving the ﬁt on average by 4.3◦ across the gait cycle. This was statistically signiﬁcant at all joints for walk- ing and running, and half the joints for stair ascent\/descent. Conclusions: For walking and running, kinematic individu- ality can be easily generalized within mode, but the trends are mixed on stairs depending on joint.

It has been shown that they are capable of attaining improved temporal and propulsive symmetry when walking with a powered knee prosthesis and visual feedback, but they perceive this pattern of gait to be more difficult. Rather than improving the efficiency of gait, improved gait symmetry may be increasing individuals’ effort associated with maintaining lateral balance. Methods: In this study, we used a simple visual feedback paradigm to increase the prosthesis-side stance time of six individuals with unilateral TFA or KD as they walked on a powered knee prosthesis at their self-selected speed. As they walked more symmetrically, we evaluated changes in medial-lateral center-of-mass excursion, lateral margin of stability, stride width, and hip abductor activity. Results: As the subjects increased their prosthesis-side stance time, their center-of-mass excursion and hip abductor activity significantly increased, while their lateral margin of stability significantly decreased on the prosthesis-side only. Stride width remained relatively unchanged with testing condition. Conclusions: Extended stance time on a powered knee prosthesis (yielding more symmetric gait) challenged the lateral balance of individuals with lower limb amputation. Lateral stability may be a reason they prefer an asymmetric gait, even with more advanced technology. Hip muscular changes post-amputation may contribute to the decline in stability on the prosthesis side. Interventions and advancements in prosthesis control aimed at improving their control of lateral balance may ameliorate the difficulty in walking with improved gait symmetry.

In this paper, the performance of a piezoelectric energy harvester embedded within custom-designed knee implant in powering RF transmitter was evaluated through simulations. This power harvester is composed of four piezoelectric generators along with four off-the-shelf power conditioning circuits. It can har- vest electric power from dynamic forces dissipated inside knee implant during walking. The results demonstrate the possibility to deliver a constant electric power of 59.4mW during a simu- lated walking cycle. This conditioned power can operate an off- the-shelf ultra-low power RF transmitter. This may eliminate the need for rechargeable batteries to power instrumented knee implants. The proposed piezoelectric generator along with the ultra-miniature power conditioning and telemetry circuits may be integrated within the knee implant without increasing its physical size or changing its geometrical shape signiﬁcantly with respect to the conventional one. Therefore, its dynamic functionality and mechanical longevity may not be affected.  I. INTRODUCTION  or surgical preventive actions may be considered before damaging the implant to an extent where revision surgery is unavoidable. The preventive actions may include changes in patient’s lifestyle to avoid overloading the implant during weight-bearing athletic activities, physical therapy or even non-invasive or minimally-invasive surgical intervention. The need for revision surgery in order to replace damaged knee implants may then be reduced.  The telemetric system embedded into instrumented im- plants needs electric power to function during the in-vivo monitoring of tibiofemoral force distribution. This system can be powered by either externally via inductive coupling [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] or internally through an integrated power harvesting system.

Lum, William J. Shelstad, Megan H. Harris, & Matthew M. White Penn State Erie, The Behrend College  Traditionally, robotics are created to be user friendly from a human standpoint but recently a different theory has emerged which focuses on how the technology we use may influence how human-like we perceive each other to be. This study investigates how individual differences play in to someone’s propensity to technomorphize. The first focus was on whether those in an engineering or programming field were more likely to technomorphize than those in other fields. The second focus was to continue the validation process for the technomorphism scale and examine how machine-like humans may be perceived. Results from this study showed that those in an engineering field or programming field are more likely to technomorphize than those in different fields.  INTRODUCTION  Recently, scientists at the University of Washington have created the first human-to-human brain interface. Electrical signals coming from one human’s brain are recorded, translated by the computer and then transmitted to another brain that signals the second human to move their hand. According to researchers “When the move-right- hand signal arrived from Rao, Stocco involuntarily moved his right index finger to push the space bar on the keyboard in front of him, as if firing the cannon. He said the feeling of his hand moving involuntarily was like that of a nervous tic” (Begley, 2013).","id":"dc1a436d-a531-468c-8e4d-fbe182e88dbf"}

Ten normal subjects ascended and descended a ﬁve-step staircase at three different inclinations (24°, 30°, 42°). Three steps were instrumented with force sensors and provided 6 dof ground reactions. Kinematics was analysed by a camera-based optoelectronic system. An inverse dynamics approach was applied to compute joint moments and powers. The different kinematic and kinetic patterns of stair ascent and descent were analysed and compared to level walking patterns. Temporal gait cycle parameters and ground reactions were not signiﬁcantly affected by staircase inclination. Joint angles and moments showed a relatively low but signiﬁcant dependency on the inclination. A large inﬂuence was observed in joint powers. This can be related to the varying amount of potential energy that has to be produced (during ascent) or absorbed (during descent) by the muscles. The kinematics and kinetics of staircase walking differ considerably from level walking. Interestingly, no deﬁnite signs could be found indicating that there is an adaptation or shift in the motor patterns when moving from level to stair walking. This can be clearly seen in the foot placement: compared to level walking, the forefoot strikes the ground ﬁrst—independent from climbing direction and inclination. This and further ﬁndings suggest that there is a certain inclination angle or angular range where subjects do switch between a level walking and a stair walking gait pattern. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically slow and metabolically expensive. Passive assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses are often prescribed to increase function and independence after stroke; however, walking remains highly impaired despite—and perhaps because of—their use. We sought to determine whether a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to supplement the paretic limb’s residual ability to generate both forward propulsion and ground clearance could facilitate more normal walking after stroke. Exosuits transmit mechanical power generated by actuators to a wearer through the interaction of garment-like, functional textile anchors and cable-based transmissions. We evaluated the immediate effects of an exosuit actively assisting the paretic limb of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery during treadmill and overground walking. Using controlled, treadmill-based biomechanical investigation, we demonstrate that exosuits can function in synchrony with a wearer’s paretic limb to facilitate an immediate 5.33 ± 0.91° increase in the paretic ankle’s swing phase dorsiflexion and 11 ± 3% increase in the paretic limb’s generation of forward propulsion (P < 0.05). These improvements in paretic limb function contributed to a 20 ± 4% reduction in forward propulsion interlimb asymmetry and a 10 ± 3% reduc- tion in the energy cost of walking, which is equivalent to a 32 ± 9% reduction in the metabolic burden associated with poststroke walking. Relatively low assistance (~12% of biological torques) delivered with a lightweight and nonrestrictive exosuit was sufficient to facilitate more normal walking in ambulatory individuals after stroke. Future work will focus on understanding how exosuit-induced improvements in walking performance may be leveraged to improve mobility after stroke.","id":"b762abec-8f90-4986-b433-8e1ccdc95199"}

In this paper, we proposed a novel soft knee exoskeleton based on continuum structure. The bionic design is from the knee exten- sion mechanism: extensor contraction stretching the patella on the gap of the femur and tibia. Concept and prototype design were presented in detail. In the continuum structure, two adjacent modules have two major degrees of freedom, which are bilateral siding and unilateral rotation. The end motion area of the continuum can meet the knee joint feature which is coupled motion with sliding and rotating between the femur and tibia. In addition, a high-power cable-driven actuator was developed to drive the exoskeleton. Tension control results indicated that the actuator can track the force quickly and accurately at fast movement. Walking experi- ments on two subjects wearing the proposed exoskeleton at slow, normal and fast speeds were carried out. Knee joint kinematic data show ﬂexible and natural gait motion.  Keywords: Soft exoskeleton · Cable-driven and continuum  1 Introduction  Lower-limb exoskeletons have been proposed and developed in military or medi- cal applications, aiming for human argumentation, motion aid and rehabilitation training [1]. Recently, soft exoskeletons as a research focus, use cables anchored to the human body by soft fabric to transfer power. They have several advan- tages compared with the rigid ones composed of rigid links and simpliﬁed joints. At ﬁrst, no robotic joint means there is no misalignment and constrain problem between the human joint and the exoskeleton joint due to complexity and multi- degrees of freedom (DoF) of biologic joint. Secondly, the soft exoskeleton can be made lightweight and compact. These can obtain more ﬂexible and natural motion during the human gait assistance, e.g. highly dynamic locomotion [2]. c Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 H. Yu et al.

Molinaro , Graduate Student Member, IEEE, Gayeon Choi, Jonathan Camargo , and Aaron J. Young , Member, IEEE  Abstract—Autonomous lower-limb exoskeletons must modulate assistance based on locomotion mode (e.g., to the corresponding to adapt ramp or stair ascent) changes in human biological joint dynamics. However, cur- rent mode classiﬁcation strategies for exoskeletons often require user-speciﬁc tuning, have a slow update rate, and rely on additional sensors outside of the exoskeleton sen- sor suite. In this study, we introduce a deep convolutional neural network-based locomotion mode classiﬁer for hip exoskeleton applications using an open-source gait biome- chanics dataset with various wearable sensors. Our ap- proach removed the limitations of previous systems as it is 1) subject-independent (i.e., no user-speciﬁc data), 2) ca- pable of continuously classifying for smooth and seamless mode transitions, and 3) only utilizes minimal wearable sen- sors native to a conventional hip exoskeleton. We optimized our model, based on several important factors contribut- ing to overall performance, such as transition label timing, model architecture, and sensor placement, which provides a holistic understanding of mode classiﬁer design. Our optimized DL model showed a 3.13% classiﬁcation error (steady-state: 0.80 ± 0.38% and transitional: 6.49 ± 1.42%), outperforming other machine learning-based benchmarks commonly practiced in the ﬁeld (p<0.05). Furthermore, our multi-modal analysis indicated that our model can main- tain high performance in different settings such as unseen slopes on stairs or ramps. Thus, our study presents a novel locomotion mode framework, capable of advancing robotic exoskeleton applications toward assisting community am- bulation.

Traditionally, collection of kinetics is mostly lim- ited to the lab environment because it relies on data that are measured from a motion capture system and ﬂoor- embedded force plates to calculate the dynamics via mus- culoskeletal models. This spatially limited method makes it extremely challenging to measure kinetics outside the laboratory in a variety of walking conditions due to the expensive device setup and large space required. Recently, employing machine learning with IMU sensors are sug- gested as an alternative method for biomechanical analy- ses. Although these methods enable estimating human ki- netic data outside the laboratory by linking IMU sensor data with kinetics dataset, they are limited to show inaccurate kinetic estimates even in highly repeatable single walking conditions due to the employment of generic deep learn- ing algorithms. Thus, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model, Kinetics-FM-DLR-Ensemble-Net for single limb prediction of hip, knee, and ankle joint moments and 3-dimensional GRFs using three IMU sensors on the thigh, shank, and foot under several representatives walking con- ditions in daily living, such as treadmill, level-ground, stair, and ramp. This is the ﬁrst study that implements both joint moments and GRFs in multiple walking conditions using IMU sensors via deep learning. Our deep learning model is versatile and accurate for identifying human kinetics across diverse subjects and walking conditions and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning model for kinetics estimation by a large margin.

Leg exoskeleton reduces the meta- bolic cost of human hopping. J Appl Physiol 107: 670–678, 2009. First published May 7, 2009; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.91609.2008.— During bouncing gaits such as hopping and running, leg muscles generate force to enable elastic energy storage and return primarily from tendons and, thus, demand metabolic energy. In an effort to reduce metabolic demand, we designed two elastic leg exoskeletons that act in parallel with the wearer’s legs; one exoskeleton consisted of a multiple leaf (MLE) and the other of a single leaf (SLE) set of ﬁberglass springs. We hypothesized that hoppers, hopping on both legs, would adjust their leg stiffness while wearing an exoskeleton so that the combination of the hopper and exoskeleton would behave as a linear spring-mass system with the same total stiffness as during normal hopping. We also hypothesized that decreased leg force generation while wearing an exoskeleton would reduce the metabolic power required for hopping. Nine subjects hopped in place at 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 Hz with and without an exoskeleton while we measured ground reaction forces, exoskeletal compression, and metabolic rates. While wearing an exoskeleton, hoppers adjusted their leg stiffness to maintain linear spring-mass mechanics and a total stiffness similar to normal hopping. Without accounting for the added weight of each exoskeleton, wearing the MLE reduced net metabolic power by an average of 6% and wearing the SLE reduced net metabolic power by an average of 24% compared with hopping normally at frequencies between 2.0 and 2.6 Hz. Thus, when hoppers used external parallel springs, they likely decreased the mechanical work performed by the legs and substantially reduced metabolic demand compared with hopping without wearing an exoskeleton.","id":"9a23803c-b3f5-4a5b-8c56-0c986f36bf74"}

Over the last decades, acoustic emission (AE) monitoring, a technique widely used in non-destructive testing, has also been introduced in orthopedics as a diagnostic tool. This review aims to synthesize the literature on the use of AE monitoring for the assessment of hip and knee joints or implants, highlighting the practical aspects and implementation considerations. Methods: this review was conducted as per the PRISMA statement for scoping reviews. All types of studies, with no limits on date of publication, were considered. Articles were assessed and study design parameters and technical characteristics were extracted from relevant studies. Results: conducted search identified 1379 articles and 64 were kept for charting. Seven additional articles were added at a later stage. Reviewed works were grouped into studies on joint condition assessment, implant assessment, and hardware or software development. Native knees and hip implants were most commonly assessed. The most researched conditions were osteoarthritis, implant loosening or squeaking in vivo and structural damage of implants in vitro. Conclusion: in recent years, AE monitoring showed potential of becoming a useful diagnostic tool for lower limb pathologies. However, further research is needed to refine the existing methods and assess their feasibility in early diagnostics.

A human subject experiment demonstrates accurate torque control with high output torque during stance and low backdrive torque during swing at fast walking speeds. This work shows that backdrivability, precise torque control, high torque output, and light weight can be achieved in a powered orthosis without the high cost and complexity of variable transmissions, clutches, and\/or series elastic components.  I. INTRODUCTION  Physical training is often needed for patients to relearn how to walk after a stroke [1]–[3]. However, the frequency and availability of physical training are limited by ﬁnite medical resources. To address this, researchers are investigating powered lower-limb rehabilitation orthoses to relieve the repetitive and physically tasking duties of therapists as well as to improve patient recovery efﬁcacy [4]. Currently, most lower-limb rehabilitation orthoses are stationary and only available in a small number of hospitals, due to high cost and large size. A personal mobile lower-limb orthosis that can be used in the clinic or at home is desirable for different rehabilitation purposes [5].","id":"4d1ccc30-f9c6-4f8d-a800-6b08ecb23531"}

Adam Quirk1,3, Jason M. Cherin1, Dennis Friedrich1, Daekyum Kim1,2 & Conor J. Walsh1  Back exoskeletons are gaining attention for preventing occupational back injuries, but they can disrupt movement, a burden that risks abandonment. Enhanced adaptability is proposed to mitigate burdens, but perceptual benefits are less known. This study investigates the perceptual and biomechanical impacts of a SLACK suit (non-assistive) controller versus three controllers with varying adaptability: a Weight-Direction-Angle adaptive (WDA-ADPT) that scales assistance based on the weight of the boxes using a chest-mounted camera and machine learning algorithm, movement direction, and trunk flexion angle, and standard Direction-Angle adaptive (DA-ADPT) and Angle adaptive (A-ADPT) controllers. Fifteen participants performed a variable weight (2, 8, 14 kg) box-transfer task. WDA-ADPT achieved the highest perceptual score (88%) across survey categories and reduced peak back extensor (BE) muscle amplitudes by 10.1%. DA-ADPT had slightly lower perceptual (76%) and peak BE reduction (8.5%). A-ADPT induced hip restriction, which could explain the lowest perceptual score (55%) despite providing the largest reductions in peak BE muscle activity (17.3%). Reduced perceptual scores achieved by DA and A-ADPT were explained by controllers providing too much or little assistance versus actual task demands. These findings underscore that scaling assistance to task demands improves biomechanical benefits and the perception of the device’s suitability.  Back exos, including exoskeletons and exosuits, have been developed to reduce the risk of occupational low back injuries (LBI)1posed by tasks with high peak and cumulative lumbar moments2–4. Engineering controls designed to reduce lumbar moments, such as adjusting table height and installing electric hoists, have demonstrated reductions in LBI rates5. Given that back exos effectively reduce back extensor (BE) moments and muscle activity1, they could mitigate the risk of developing occupational LBIs6,7. However, devices must have a high intention to maximize this potential8.","id":"55c31e5b-8329-422e-9a3c-81b06a3435ce"}

Whether augmenting abilities or improv- ing disabilities, the purpose of assistive exoskeleton devices is to provide useful mechanical power by means of synchronous operation with the person that is wearing it [3].

Conventionally, measurements of body motion are obtained by motion capture cameras, of which the bulkiness and high cost make it hard to capture some movements that need broad range of space. As an alternative, inertial motion sensing using cheap and small microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based inertial sensors has been proposed. Inertial motion sensing allows ambulatory movement and is also free of occlusion problem. It has been actively studied for recent 2 decades, but until now, most researches have focused on measuring only the kinematics of body segments. In this research, the performance of inertial motion sensing especially aimed at inverse dynamics analysis is studied for squat motion. Kinematic data from inertial motion sensors are used to calculate the normal ground reaction force (GRF), which is evaluated based on the force plate measurement (ground truth) and additionally compared to the estimation result using optical motion sensing system. Squat motion, which can be simply modeled as a 3-segment linkage moving in sagittal plane is targeted. The normal GRF estimation result showed high correlation and low RMSE (R=0.93, RMSE<0.02 of body weight), which guarantees enough accuracy of inertial motion sensing to be used for estimating joint forces\/torques through inverse dynamics analysis about squat. I. INTRODUCTION The information about joint force\/torque of human body while conducting certain movement, is essential to analyze the cause of the movement.[1] The information of joint force\/torque, which originate the movement of joints enables deeper understanding of human motions. For example, the role of each joint and the function of related muscles can be known, and the energy analysis is also available. This joint force\/torque can be directly measured by invasive method [2], but the application is extremely limited. In most cases, inverse dynamics analysis is the only way to get the joint force\/torque information of human motion. The inverse dynamics analysis is based on Newtonian dynamics, as it applies equations of motion of body segments, which are obtained by assuming each body segment as one rigid link model. This analysis requires the inertial parameters and motion information of each body segment. Inertial parameters are usually estimated based on anthropometry [3], and motion information is acquired by motion sensing systems","id":"933a5302-6898-409e-91e1-b3a4dfea8eac"}

INTRODUCTION  G AIT training (or exercises) using a robotic exoskeleton  can be an appropriate solution for those who need to improve their walking performance due to aging or disease. Hip and ankle assistance, for example, is expected to lessen the problem of excessive use of the hip muscles or a bent posture to compensateforweakeneddistalmusclestrengthandbalance[1], [2]. It is expected that knee assistance can effectively improve a gait rehabilitation and training program in patients who suffer from arthritis [3] or have joint replacements.  To maximize the training effect using an exoskeleton device, interaction force should be applied naturally in accordance with the wearer’s original walking pattern. Because the exoskeleton device’s weight and motion constraints can distort the user’s originalgaitpattern,reducingthedevice’sweightandimproving its wearability should take precedence. The device’s usability, maintenance and manufacturing costs, and ease of wear are also key factors that cannot be overlooked.","id":"0c9122a3-f782-4c71-af92-a4b42fc9ff35"}

In this paper, we proposed a novel soft knee exoskeleton based on continuum structure. The bionic design is from the knee exten- sion mechanism: extensor contraction stretching the patella on the gap of the femur and tibia. Concept and prototype design were presented in detail. In the continuum structure, two adjacent modules have two major degrees of freedom, which are bilateral siding and unilateral rotation. The end motion area of the continuum can meet the knee joint feature which is coupled motion with sliding and rotating between the femur and tibia. In addition, a high-power cable-driven actuator was developed to drive the exoskeleton. Tension control results indicated that the actuator can track the force quickly and accurately at fast movement. Walking experi- ments on two subjects wearing the proposed exoskeleton at slow, normal and fast speeds were carried out. Knee joint kinematic data show ﬂexible and natural gait motion.  Keywords: Soft exoskeleton · Cable-driven and continuum  1 Introduction  Lower-limb exoskeletons have been proposed and developed in military or medi- cal applications, aiming for human argumentation, motion aid and rehabilitation training [1]. Recently, soft exoskeletons as a research focus, use cables anchored to the human body by soft fabric to transfer power. They have several advan- tages compared with the rigid ones composed of rigid links and simpliﬁed joints. At ﬁrst, no robotic joint means there is no misalignment and constrain problem between the human joint and the exoskeleton joint due to complexity and multi- degrees of freedom (DoF) of biologic joint. Secondly, the soft exoskeleton can be made lightweight and compact. These can obtain more ﬂexible and natural motion during the human gait assistance, e.g. highly dynamic locomotion [2]. c Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 H. Yu et al.

Robertson, Jean-Marie J. Wilson, and Taunya A. St. Pierre University of Ottawa  The purpose of this research was to determine the functions of the gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles about their associated joints during full (deep-knee) squats. Muscle func- tion was determined from joint kinematics, inverse dynamics, electromyography, and muscle length changes. The subjects were six experienced, male weight lifters. Analyses revealed that the prime movers during ascent were the monoarticular gluteus maximus and vasti muscles (as exemplified by vastus latera- lis) and to a lesser extent the soleus muscles. The biarticular muscles functioned mainly as stabilizers of the ankle, knee, and hip joints by working eccentrically to control descent or transferring energy among the segments during ascent. During the ascent phase, the hip exten- sor moments of force produced the largest powers followed by the ankle plantar flexors and then the knee extensors. The hip and knee extensors provided the initial bursts of power during ascent with the ankle extensors and especially a second burst from the hip exten- sors adding power during the latter half of the ascent.

In this study, we examined hip and knee joint kinetics during stair climbing in 35 young healthy subjects using a subject-speciﬁc knee model to estimate bone-on-bone tibiofemoral and patello-femoral joint contact forces. The net knee forces were below one body weight while the peak posterior–anterior contact force was close to one body weight. The peak distal–proximal contact force was on average 3 times body weight and could be as high as 6 times body weight. These contact forces occurred at a high degree of knee ﬂexion where there is a smaller joint contact area resulting in high contact stresses. The peak knee adduction moment was 0.42 (0.15) N m\/kg while the ﬂexion moment was 1.16 (0.24) N m\/kg. Similar peak moment values, but different curve proﬁles, were found for the hip. The hip and knee posterio-anterior shear forces and the knee ﬂexion moment were higher during stair climbing than during level walking. The most striking difference between stair ascent and level walking was that the peak patello-femoral contact force was 8 times higher during stair ascent.

We performed an experiment to study the independent effects of net exoskeleton work and average exoskeleton torque on human locomo- tion. Subjects wore a unilateral ankle exoskeleton and walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m·s1 while net exoskeleton work rate was system- atically varied from 0.054 to 0.25 J·kg1·s1, with constant (0.12 N·m·kg1) average exoskeleton torque, and while average exoskele- ton torque was systematically varied from approximately zero to 0.18 N·m·kg1, with approximately zero net exoskeleton work. We mea- sured metabolic rate, center-of-mass mechanics, joint mechanics, and muscle activity. Both techniques reduced effort-related measures at the assisted ankle, but this form of work input reduced metabolic cost (17% with maximum net work input) while this form of torque support increased metabolic cost (13% with maximum average torque). Disparate effects on metabolic rate seem to be due to cascading effects on whole body coordination, particularly related to assisted ankle muscle dynamics and the effects of trailing ankle behavior on leading leg mechanics during double support.

Providing personalized external assistance though is challenging due to uncertainties and the time-varying nature of human-robot interaction. Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) op- timization has been investigated for providing assistance to mini- mize energetic expenditure, usually quantiﬁed by metabolic cost. However, this full-body global effect evaluation may not directly reﬂect the local functions of the targeted joint(s). This makes it difﬁcult to assess the direct effect when robotic assistance is pro- vided. In addition, the HIL optimization method usually does not take into account local joint trajectories, a consideration that is important in imposing healthy joint movements and gait patterns for individuals with lower limb motor deﬁcits.

Recently, various types of wearable walking assist robots have been developed to improve gait function and metabolic efficiency for elderly adults. Several studies have shown that walking assist robots can improve cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during level walking in elderly. However, there is limited evidence demonstrating the effect of walking assist robots on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair walking in elderly adults. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the assistance effect of a newly developed wearable hip assist robot on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair ascent in elderly adults. Methods: Fifteen healthy elderly adults participated. The Gait Enhancing Mechatronic System (GEMS), developed by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Korea, was used in the present study. The metabolic energy expenditure was measured using a K4b2 while participants performed randomly assigned two conditions consecutively: free ascending stairs without the GEMS or robot-assisted ascending stair with the GEMS.","id":"ce43dd8a-b515-47be-87ce-bd3d461548e4"}

There has been an increasing de- mand for robot agents to assist in these dynamic, rapid mo- tions that are constantly evolving and require quick, accu- rate estimation of a user’s direction of travel. An experiment was conducted in a motion capture space with six subjects performing threat-evasion in 8 directions, and their mechan- ical and neuromuscular signals were recorded for use in our intent recognition system (XGBoost). Investigated against current, analytical methods, our system demonstrated supe- rior performance with quicker direction of travel estimation occurring 140 ms earlier in the movement and a 11.6◦ reduc- tion of error. The results showed that we could even predict movement start 100 ms prior to the actual, thus allowing any physical systems to start up. Our direction estimation had an optimal performance of 8.8◦, or 2.4% of the 360◦ range of travel, using 3-axis kinetic data. The performance of other sensors and their combinations indicate that there are ad- ditional possibilities to obtain low estimation error. These ﬁndings are promising as they can be used to inform the de- sign of a wearable robot aimed at assisting users in dynamic motions, while in environments with oncoming threats.","id":"4518f42c-ad1f-47c3-80d6-7d265ead44f7"}

Changes in PB are often assumed as a consequence of fatigue, but effects of interventions that aim to reduce fatigue by improving PB are not sufficient. Since the heterogeneous nature of MS related symptoms, levels of PB of fatigued patients at the start of interventions might vary substantially. Better understanding of the variability by identification of PB subtypes in fatigued patients may help to develop more effective personalized rehabilitation programs in the future. This study aimed to identify PB subtypes in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis based on multidimensional PB outcome measures. Methods: Baseline accelerometer (Actigraph) data, demographics and clinical characteristics of the TREFAMS-ACE participants (n = 212) were used for secondary analysis. All patients were ambulatory and diagnosed with severe fatigue based on a score of ≥35 on the fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20r). Fifteen PB measures were used derived from 7 day measurements with an accelerometer. Principal component analysis was performed to define key outcome measures for PB and two-step cluster analysis was used to identify PB types. Results: Analysis revealed five key outcome measures: percentage sedentary behavior, total time in prolonged moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, number of sedentary bouts, and two types of change scores between day parts (morning, afternoon and evening). Based on these outcomes three valid PB clusters were derived. Conclusions: Patients with severe MS-related fatigue show three distinct and homogeneous PB subtypes. These PB subtypes, based on a unique set of PB outcome measures, may offer an opportunity to design more individually-tailored interventions in rehabilitation.

Conventionally, measurements of body motion are obtained by motion capture cameras, of which the bulkiness and high cost make it hard to capture some movements that need broad range of space. As an alternative, inertial motion sensing using cheap and small microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based inertial sensors has been proposed. Inertial motion sensing allows ambulatory movement and is also free of occlusion problem. It has been actively studied for recent 2 decades, but until now, most researches have focused on measuring only the kinematics of body segments. In this research, the performance of inertial motion sensing especially aimed at inverse dynamics analysis is studied for squat motion. Kinematic data from inertial motion sensors are used to calculate the normal ground reaction force (GRF), which is evaluated based on the force plate measurement (ground truth) and additionally compared to the estimation result using optical motion sensing system. Squat motion, which can be simply modeled as a 3-segment linkage moving in sagittal plane is targeted. The normal GRF estimation result showed high correlation and low RMSE (R=0.93, RMSE<0.02 of body weight), which guarantees enough accuracy of inertial motion sensing to be used for estimating joint forces\/torques through inverse dynamics analysis about squat. I. INTRODUCTION The information about joint force\/torque of human body while conducting certain movement, is essential to analyze the cause of the movement.[1] The information of joint force\/torque, which originate the movement of joints enables deeper understanding of human motions. For example, the role of each joint and the function of related muscles can be known, and the energy analysis is also available. This joint force\/torque can be directly measured by invasive method [2], but the application is extremely limited. In most cases, inverse dynamics analysis is the only way to get the joint force\/torque information of human motion. The inverse dynamics analysis is based on Newtonian dynamics, as it applies equations of motion of body segments, which are obtained by assuming each body segment as one rigid link model. This analysis requires the inertial parameters and motion information of each body segment. Inertial parameters are usually estimated based on anthropometry [3], and motion information is acquired by motion sensing systems","id":"933a5302-6898-409e-91e1-b3a4dfea8eac"}

Young  Abstract—Lower limb exoskeletons provide assistance during the gait cycle using a state variable, one in particular is gait phase. This is crucial for the exoskeleton controller to provide the user accurate assistance. Conventional methods often utilize an event marker to estimate gait phase by computing the average stride time. However, this strategy has limitations in adapting to dynamic speeds. We developed a sensor fusion-based neural network model to estimate the gait phase in real-time that can adapt to dynamic speeds ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 m\/s. Ten able- bodied subjects walked with an exoskeleton using our estimator and were provided with corresponding torque assistance. Our best performing model had RMSE below 29 ms and 4% for real-time estimation and torque generation, respectively, reducing the estimation error by 36.0% (p < 0.01) and torque error by 40.9% (p < 0.001) compared to conventional methods. Our results indicate that creating a general user-independent model and additionally training on user-speciﬁc data outperforms the user- speciﬁc model and user-independent model. Our study validates the feasibility of using a sensor fusion-based machine learning model to accurately estimate the user’s gait phase and improve the controllability of a lower limb exoskeleton.

The setup of the mechanomyography (MMG) measurement is simpler than the setup for sur- face electromyography (sEMG) measurement and is less affected by sweating. However, torque estimation based on a mechanomyogram involves signiﬁcant noise, which is an important issue. Therefore, we propose a regression analy- sis method to estimate the torque of the knee joint during voluntary movement based on the MMG signal. The pro- posed method differs from conventional methods because it integrates the MMG sensor responses at four locations: anterior, posterior, and medial\/lateral just above the main operating muscle. This method focuses on the acceleration response characteristics, which change slightly depending on the location of the MMG sensor. Support vector regres- sion was performed on the root mean square (RMS) of the MMG signals, which were processed by a low-pass ﬁlter. Two-channel estimation with an increased number of MMG sensors for the leading and antagonist muscles improved the conventional method, and four-channel estimation with medial and lateral sensors further improved the perfor- mance.

IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS  Gait-Generation Strategy for Lower Limb Exoskeleton Based on Central Pattern Generator  Wen Duan , Weihai Chen , Member, IEEE, Jianhua Wang , Jingmeng Liu , Zhongcai Pei and Jianer Chen  Abstract—To improve human–machine interactions, many studies have replicated the human motor nervous system to control lower limb exoskeletons. However, this approach is hindered by its intricacy and the disparities be- tween human and machine capabilities, leading to subopt- imal adaptability and constrained practicality. This article presents a gait-generation strategy for lower limb exoskele- tons utilizing central pattern generators (CPGs). This method offers a simpliﬁed model compared with the tradi- tional CPG methods, signiﬁcantly easing the parameter op- timization process. The strategy is bifurcated into two seg- ments. The initial segment encapsulates the human motor nervous system, constructs a musculoskeletal structure, and generates a basic bionic gait. The subsequent segment employs adaptive oscillators to assimilate and reﬁne this basic gait through weak coupling theory. It further broadens the application range by integrating variational controllers and state observers. We implemented this strategy in a bench-type lower limb exoskeleton, allowing adjustments in walking speed and integrating a preference control algorithm for personalized exoskeleton management.

Scherpereel*, Dean D. Molinaro, Max K. Shepherd, Omer T. Inan, and Aaron J. Young  Abstract— Objective: Real-time measurement of biological joint moment could enhance clinical assessments and generalize exoskeleton control. Accessing joint moments outside clinical and laboratory settings requires harnessing non-invasive wearable sensor data for indirect estimation. Previous approaches have been primarily validated during cyclic tasks, such as walking, but these methods are likely limited when translating to non-cyclic tasks where the mapping from kinematics to moments is not unique. Methods: We trained deep learning models to estimate hip and sensors, electromyography (EMG), and simulated pressure insoles from a dataset including 10 cyclic and 18 non-cyclic activities. We assessed estimation error on combinations of sensor modalities during both activity types. Results: Compared to the kinematics- only baseline, adding EMG reduced RMSE by 16.9% at the hip and 30.4% at the knee (p<0.05) and adding insoles reduced RMSE by 21.7% at the hip and 33.9% at the knee (p<0.05). Adding both modalities reduced RMSE by 32.5% at the hip and 41.2% at the knee (p<0.05) which was significantly higher than either modality individually (p<0.05). All sensor additions improved model performance on non-cyclic tasks more than cyclic tasks (p<0.05). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that adding kinetic sensor information through EMG or insoles improves joint moment estimation both individually and jointly. These additional modalities are most important during non-cyclic tasks, tasks that reflect the variable and sporadic nature of the real-world.

Our approach combines the concepts of machine learning and musculoskeletal modeling. Methods: We compared our novel design with a musculoskeletal model (MM) and 2 continuous EMG decoders based on artificial neural networks (ANNs): multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and nonlinear autoregressive neural networks with exogenous inputs (NARX networks). EMG and joint kinematics data were collected from 10 non-disabled and 1 transradial amputee subject. The offline performance tested across 3 different conditions (i.e. varied arm postures, shifted electrode locations, and noise-contaminated EMG signals) and online performance for a virtual postural matching task was quantified. Finally, we implemented the N2M2 to operate a prosthetic hand and tested functional task performance. Results: The N2M2 made more accurate predictions than the MLP in all postures and electrode locations (p<0.003). For estimated MCP joint angles, the N2M2 was less sensitive to noisy EMG signals than the MM or NARX network with respect to error (p<0.032) as well as the NARX network with respect to correlation (p=0.007). Additionally, the N2M2 had better online task performance than the NARX network (p≤0.030). Conclusion: Overall, we have found that combining the concepts of machine learning and musculoskeletal modeling has resulted in a more robust joint kinematics decoder than either concept individually. Significance: The outcome of this study may result in a novel, highly reliable controller for powered prosthetic hands.

Sarkisian, Marshall K. Ishmael, Grace R. Hunt, and Tommaso Lenzi, Member, IEEE  Abstract— Powered knee exoskeletons aim to assist individuals with lower limb impairments by providing power and torque at the joint level. However, if the anatomical and exoskeleton joints are not perfectly aligned, the exoskeleton assistance may result in spurious forces and torques transferred to the user’s limb. These spurious forces and torques can then generate undesired loads on the user’s joint and shear stress on the user’s skin, causing pain and ultimately undermining the exoskeleton assistance. To address this issue, we propose a novel powered knee exoskeleton with a self-aligning mechanism using a prismatic-revolute- revolute (PRR) configuration. The proposed self-aligning mechanism weighs 190 g (i.e., 5.3% of the total exoskeleton weight) and can transmit up to 120 Nm of torque at the knee joint (i.e., biological peak torque for a 50th percentile male climbing stairs). Our experiments show that during assisted sit-to-stand transfers the peaks of the spurious torques and forces are below 0.5 Nm and 5 N, respectively, even if misalignments are intentionally added between the user and the exoskeleton. This study supports the use of self-aligning mechanisms in powered exoskeletons.  are neglected, perfect static alignment between the powered and anatomical axes is not possible as the anatomical axis cannot be located accurately when wearing the powered exoskeleton. Finally, a perfectly aligned exoskeleton may become misaligned due to the compression of the user’s soft tissues or flexibility of the human-robot interface generated by the interaction forces between the user and the exoskeleton [8].","id":"61256b5a-e81b-4789-b4ab-427c5ae7b13f"}

ACCEPTED JANUARY 2022 1 Abstract—Ankle exoskeletons have the potential to improve mobility, but common controllers are often inflexible to variations in tasks, such as changes in walking speed. To enable effective variable-speed exoboot control, we developed and validated a two-headed convolutional neural network trained to (1) classify stance versus swing and (2) predict the phase during stance, which was then mapped to a desired exoboot torque. This Machine Learning Estimator (MLE) was trained from nine participants walking at three speeds and four exoboot assistance levels. A Time-Based Estimator (TBE) that predicted gait phase from the two previous stride durations was used to apply realistic torques during MLE training and served as a within–participant control condition. The MLE was validated online with three new participants walking at a range of speeds and torques, both interpolating within and extrapolating outside the training set. Online validation accuracy (RMSE) across tested speeds and torque levels was 3.9%. On a simple walking task in which treadmill speed was varied sinusoidally between 1.1 and 1.6 m\/s with a 30 s period, the three participants exhibited a mean 5.2% decrease in metabolic expenditure with the MLE compared to no-exo (boots only), but exhibited a 5.4% increase when walking with the TBE. The MLE more accurately predicted heel strike and toe off events (heel strike Mean Absolute Error: 9.6 ms; toe off MAE: 13.2 ms) than the TBE (heel strike MAE: 19.1 ms; toe off MAE: 34 ms). These positive results validated the potential of using a deep learning model for gait state estimation to effectively control an ankle exoskeleton across variable walking speeds.

Abstract—Lower limb prosthesis can beneﬁt from embedded systems capable of applying computer vision techniques to en- hance autonomous control and context awareness for intelligent decision making. In order to ﬁll in the gap of current literature of autonomous systems for prosthetic legs employing computer vision methods, we evaluate the performance capabilities of two off-the-shelf platforms, the Jetson TX2 and Raspberry Pi 3, by assessing their CPU load, memory usage, run time and classiﬁcation accuracy for different image sizes and widespread computer vision algorithms. We make use of a dataset that we collected for terrain recognition using images from a camera mounted on a leg, which would enable context-awareness for lower limb prosthesis. We show that, given reasonably large images and an appropriate frame selection method, it is possible to identify the terrain that a subject is going to step on, with the possibility of reconstructing the surface and obtaining its inclination. This is part of a proposed system equipped with an embedded camera and inertial measurement unit to recognize different types of terrain and estimate the slope of the surface in front of the subject.  I. INTRODUCTION  The relevance of providing a better quality of life to people with limb loss has only increased over time. The prospective amputee population growth is estimated to reach about 3.6 million by 2050 in the United States alone [1]. In order to improve amputee’s quality of life, diverse types of prostheses have been employed; however, there is no prosthetic solution to date that completely addresses the lack of comfort, reliability, and safety to the user, which are claimed by several amputees as the main reasons not to wear them [2]. One of the main challenges is to provide devices that are able to be natural extensions of the human body, which is an open research topic that branches across several areas: orthopedics, cardiology, neurology and many areas of engineering.","id":"cf82acd0-bef8-458d-8a50-fd77644941f3"}

Powered Hip Exoskeletons can Reduce the User’s Hip and Ankle Muscle Activations during Walking  T. Lenzi, Student Member IEEE, M.C. Carrozza, Member, IEEE, and S.K. Agrawal Member, IEEE  Abstract— In this paper, we study the human locomotor adaptation to the action of a powered exoskeleton providing assistive torque at the user’s hip during walking. To this end, we propose a controller that provides the user’s hip with a fraction of the nominal torque profile, adapted to the specific gait features of the user from Winter’s reference data [34]. The assistive controller has been implemented on the ALEX II exoskeleton and tested on ten healthy subjects. Experimental results show that when assisted by the exoskeleton, users can reduce the muscle effort compared to free walking. Despite providing assistance only to the hip joint, both hip and ankle muscles significantly reduced their activation, indicating a clear tradeoff between hip and ankle strategy to propel walking.  muscle strength and endurance (e.g., myopathies) [14], or lowering the maximum sustainable cardiac effort (e.g., peripheral arterial diseases) [15]. A pathological condition of the lower-limb articulations (e.g., hip pain, osteoarthritis) can result in an onset of pain that reduces the patient’s walking ability as well [16]. In either case, by using an assistive exoskeleton that can reduce the muscle force required to walk, patients might recover their normal movement ability and improve their physical and social health [17]-[19]. The growing elderly population increases the incidence of these pathologies, and together with longer life expectancy, the study of non-pharmacological solutions. motivates Assistive exoskeletons may present an alternative way of restoring normal walking in these population groups.

This study aimed to profile gait pathology in gait-impaired patients with MS using comprehensive 3D gait analysis and clinical walking tests. Thirty-seven patients with MS walked on the treadmill at their individual, sustainable speed while 20 healthy control subjects walked at all the different patient’s paces, allowing for comparisons independent of walking velocity. Kinematic analysis revealed pronounced restrictions in knee and ankle joint excursion, increased gait variability and asymmetry along with impaired dynamic stability in patients. The most discriminative single gait parameter, differentiating patients from controls with an accuracy of 83.3% (χ2 test; p = 0.0001), was reduced knee range of motion. Based on hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis, three principal pathological gait patterns were identified: a spastic-paretic, an ataxia-like, and an unstable gait. Follow-up assessments after 1 year indicated deterioration of walking function, particularly in patients with spastic-paretic gait patterns. Our findings suggest that impaired knee\/ankle control is common in patients with MS. Personalised gait profiles and clustering algorithms may be promising tools for stratifying patients and to inform patient- tailored exercise programs. Responsive, objective outcome measures are important for monitoring disease progression and treatment effects in MS trials.","id":"7fced4b7-b250-4abc-8c49-1e60d4ed0793"}

The paper describes the basic mechanics of this 3D flexible frame and its stiffness characteristics. We implemented the 3D flexible frame on a gait enhancing mechatronic system and conducted experiments. The performance of the proposed mechanism is verified by simulation and experiments. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, various types of exoskeletons have been developed to perform various tasks, ranging from lifting of heavy loads to aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals. Recently, efforts have been made to adapt them to the needs of public users such as elderly and infirm people. Using such a device to assist their walk or movements enables them to lead more active and independent lives. However, when compared with a device for the disabled who are completely dependent on an assistive device, the device for the general elderly and infirm people has to satisfy more stringent performance standards, such as higher assistive performance, better wearability, and lower product weight. In addition, the device should be able to provide a new user experience. Wearability and usability are the main issues with traditional exoskeleton mechanisms, which are usually composed of rigid frames with straps and are fitted at a certain location on the body [1-4]. With rigid frames, such a mechanism can support its own weight, and additional loads such as the weight of the wearer and the objects carried by him\/her. It can transmit the assisting torque from the actuator to the wearer’s body. On the other hand, its structure cannot be tightly fitted to the wearer’s lower body because of the rigid frames. It is too heavy and bulky, resulting in the high energy cost. Moreover, it also affects the natural gait dynamics and kinematics of the user. As an alternative to rigid exoskeletons, active soft orthotic systems [5-7] which can be tightly fitted to the wearer’s body have been developed. As compared to the traditional exoskeletons, these systems provide minimal mechanical impedance and kinematic restrictions.

Considering the complexity of the exercise and the many variables related to performance, understanding squat biomechanics is of great importance for both achieving optimal muscular development as well as reducing the prospect of a training-related injury. Therefore, the purpose of this article is 2-fold: ﬁrst, to examine kinematics and kinetics of the dynamic squat with respect to the ankle, knee, hip and spinal joints and, second, to provide recommendations based on these bio- mechanical factors for optimizing exercise performance.

It has biomechanical and neuromuscular similar- ities to a wide range of athletic movements and thus is included as a core exercise in many sports routines designed to enhanceathletic performance (20,62).

Given that most activities of daily living necessitate the simultaneous coordinated interaction of numerous muscle groups, the squat is considered one of the best exercises for improving quality of life because of its ability to recruit multiple muscle groups in a single maneuver (22). The squatting movement has close speciﬁcity to many everyday tasks (such as lifting packages and picking up children), as well as having an indirect correlation to count- less other chores and hobbies.  The squat also is becoming increasingly popular in clinical settings as a means to strengthen lower-body muscles and connective tissue after joint-related injury. It has been used extensively for therapeutic treatment of ligament lesions, patellofemoral dysfunctions, total joint replacement, and ankle instability (14,56). Moreover, the closed-chain stance required for performance reduces anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strain (64), making it superior to the knee extension for rehabilitation of ACL injury (21,65).","id":"b78970cd-97cc-4ef6-865a-24e29bc484d3"}

Young Ph.D.  Abstract— Despite there being studies that have investigated the effects of human augmentation using a knee exoskeleton, comparing different assistance schemes on a single knee exoskeleton has not been studied. Using a light-weight, low- profile bilateral knee exoskeleton system, this study examined and compared the biomechanical effects of three common assistance strategies impedance, and proportional myoelectric controllers) exhibiting different levels of flexibility for the user to control the assistance. Nine subjects walked on a 15% gradient incline surface at 1.1 m\/s in the three powered conditions and with the exoskeleton unpowered. All the assistance strategies significantly reduced the metabolic cost of the users compared to the unpowered condition by 3.0% on average across strategies (p < 0.05), led by the significant reduction in the biological knee kinetic effort and knee extensor muscle activation (p < 0.05). Between assistance strategies, the metabolic cost and biomechanics displayed no statistically significant differences. The metabolic and biomechanical results indicate that powered extension assistance during early stance can improve performance compared to the unpowered condition. However, the user’s ability to control the assistance may not be significant for human augmentation when walking on an inclined surface with a knee exoskeleton.

Walsh  1  2  Published online: xx xx xxxx  Check for updates  Exoskeletons can augment the performance of unimpaired users and restore movement in individuals with gait impairments. Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.  Exoskeletons aiding locomotion entered the popular imagination over a century ago, followed by a series of early patents and prototypes1–5. Among other advances in the late twentieth and early twenty-first cen- tury, funding from the Exoskeleton for Human Performance Augmen- tation Program6 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States enabled the development of wearable robotic devices for the lower extremities (in particular, the Berkeley lower-extremity exoskeleton, BLEEX7,8; the Sarcos Guardian XO9; and the MIT quasi-passive exoskeleton10–13) to augment strength and reduce effort during the carriage of load. By taking load off the wearer and providing assistive joint torques during walking, these weight-bearing lower-extremity exoskeletons sought to increase load capacity, improve efficiency and endurance, and reduce the perceived difficulty of walk- ing11, potentially benefitting military personnel, first responders and weekend warriors. Measuring the metabolic cost of exoskeleton-aided locomotion became the gold standard for quantifying wearer effort and exertion. As such, demonstrating metabolic cost reductions compared to walking without the robot became a major goal for exoskeletons designed to augment strength and performance. Despite their promise, lower-extremity exoskeletons for performance augmentation in unim- paired users initially failed to demonstrate metabolic cost reductions","id":"ff3ab2f4-24d4-44f9-81d5-d43bb0694af4"}

However, existing assist devices pose problems in terms of coordination between the person and the device owing to misalignment of motion time or device motion trajectory. Therefore, an assist method with a wide range of tolerance for such misalignment is required. In a previous study focusing on viscosity characteristics, the basic assist effect of viscosity in seated motion was verified and its effectiveness was demonstrated. Consequently, the viscosity command was able to provide assistance with a wider range of tolerance for movement time and misalignment between the motion trajectory of the device and the wearer than other command methods. This study examines the assist effect of variable viscosity control in stair descent, which is a complex and cyclic knee joint motion. Experiments were conducted to compare the command signals of the variable viscosity command (proposed method) that adjusts torque based on angular velocity, time command, which modifies the output value over time, and angle command, which alters the command value according to the angle of the device. In addition, a subjective evaluation experiment was conducted using a questionnaire. The results confirmed that the variable viscosity command can accommodate a wider range of tolerance for time deviation and deviation of the motion trajectory of both the person and the device compared to other command methods. I. INTRODUCTION Wearable assist devices are directly attached to a person; therefore, it is important that they synchronize seamlessly with the movements of the wearer. Ideally, similar to human muscles, assist devices should be driven voluntarily. However, accurately reading and driving the intention of the wearer is challenging. Existing assist devices do not drive voluntarily but often output preprogrammed commands based on the information obtained from sensors or perform feedback control using sensor information from the device. However, it is difficult for the wearer to operate the assist device as expected when it is driven by preprogrammed commands based on sensor information. In addition, a discrepancy exists between the expected and actual operations.

Bartlett, J. Alex Heller, Mozziyar Etemadi, Aaron Young, Thomas Pl¨otz, and Omer T. Inan, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Objective: To estimate instantaneous oxygen uptake (VO2) with a small, low-cost wearable sensor during exercise and daily activities in order to enable monitoring of energy expenditure (EE) in uncontrolled settings. We aim to do so using a combination of seismocardiogram (SCG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and atmospheric pressure (AP) signals obtained from a minimally obtrusive wearable device. Methods: In this study, sub- jects performed a treadmill protocol in a controlled environment and an outside walking protocol in an uncontrolled environment. During testing, the COSMED K5 metabolic system collected gold standard breath-by-breath (BxB) data and a custom-built wearable patch placed on the mid-sternum collected SCG, ECG and AP signals. We extracted features from these signals to estimate the BxB VO2 data obtained from the COSMED system. Results: In estimating instantaneous VO2, we achieved our best results on the treadmill protocol using a combination of SCG (frequency) and AP features (RMSE of 3.68±0.98 ml\/kg\/min and R2 of 0.77). For the outside protocol, we achieved our best results using a combination of SCG (frequency), ECG and AP features (RMSE of 4.3±1.47 ml\/kg\/min and R2 of 0.64). In estimating VO2 consumed over one minute intervals during the protocols, our median percentage error was 15.8% for the treadmill protocol and 20.5% for the outside protocol. Conclusion: SCG, ECG and AP signals from a small wearable patch can enable accurate estimation of instantaneous VO2 in both controlled and uncontrolled settings. SCG signals capturing variation in cardio-mechanical processes, AP signals, and state of the art machine learning models contribute signiﬁcantly to the accurate estimation of instantaneous VO2. Signiﬁcance: Accurate estimation of VO2 with a low cost, minimally obtrusive wearable patch can enable the monitoring of VO2 and EE in everyday settings and make the many applications of these measurements more accessible to the general public.","id":"a756aa04-61d9-4a28-bb0b-b8174c86d9ce"}

The goals of this study were to 1) systematically investigate the biomechanics of a wearer-robot system reacting to internal errors induced by a powered knee prosthesis (PKP), and 2) quantify the error tolerable bound that does not affect the user’s gait stability. Eight non-disabled participants and two unilat- eral transfemoral amputees walked on a pathway wearing a PKP, as the controller randomly switched the control parameters to disturbance parameters to mimic the errors caused by locomotion mode misrecognition. The size of prosthesiscontrolerrorswas systematicallyvariedto deter- mine the error tolerable bound that disrupted gait stabil- ity. The effect of the error was quantiﬁed based on the 1) mechanical change described by the angular impulse applied by the PKP, and 2) overall gait instability quantiﬁed using human perception, angular momentum, and compen- satory stepping. The results showed that the error tolerable bound is dependent on the gait phase and the direction of torque change. Two balance recovery strategies were also observed to allow participants to successful respond to the induced errors. The outcomes of this study may assist the future design of an auto-tuning algorithm, volitionally- controlled powered prosthetic legs, and training of gait stability.

Bolus, Student Member, IEEE, Hyeon Ki Jeong, Bradley M. Blaho, Mohsen Safaei, Aaron J. Young, Omer T. Inan, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract— Objective: Tendons are essential components of the musculoskeletal system and, as with any mechanical structure, can fail under load. Tendon injuries are common and can be debilitating, and research suggests that a better understanding of their loading conditions could help mitigate injury risk and improve rehabilitation. To that end, we present a novel method of noninvasively assessing parameters related to mechanical load in the Achilles tendon using burst vibrations. Methods: These vibrations, produced by a small vibration motor on the skin superficial to the tendon, are sensed by a skin-mounted accelerometer, which measures the tendon’s response to burst excitation under varying tensile load. In this study, twelve healthy subjects performed a variety of everyday tasks designed to expose the Achilles tendon to a range of loading conditions. To approximate the vibration motor-tendon system and provide an explanation for observed changes in tendon response, a 2-degree- of-freedom mechanical systems model was developed. Results: Reliable, characteristic changes in the burst response profile as a function of Achilles tendon tension were observed during all loading tasks. Using a machine learning-based approach, we developed a regression model capable of accurately estimating net ankle moment—which captures general trends in tendon tension—across a range of walking speeds and across subjects (R2 = 0.85). Simulated results of the mechanical model accurately recreated behaviors observed in vivo. Finally, preliminary, proof- of-concept results from a fully wearable system demonstrated trends similar to those observed in experiments conducted using benchtop equipment. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an untethered, unobtrusive system can effectively assess tendon loading during activities of daily life. Significance: Access to such a system would have broad implications for injury recovery and prevention, athletic training, and the study of human movement.

As a potential way to assist gaits, lower limb ex- oskeletons have been developed. To supply appropriate assistive torque, real-time accurate recognition of current gait mode is important. In this article, a hierarchical con- trol system was proposed to recognize locomotion modes in real time for a unilateral knee exoskeleton on different terrains with speciﬁc assistive control strategies. Support vector machine classiﬁer was used to recognize the lo- comotion mode based on two inertia measurement units. The corresponding assistive control strategy was designed according to the recognition result. Real-time recognition experiments under assistive torque control were conducted on ﬁve able-bodied subjects and one stroke patient, respec- tively. For the able-bodied subjects: ﬁrst, no signiﬁcance was found on the total recognition accuracies whichever the leading leg was for the ﬁve subjects (p = 0.057), which indicated the proposed method in this article was suitable whichever the leading leg was as far as the overall classi- ﬁcation accuracy was concerned. Second, transitions oc- curred in swing phase when the leading leg was the paretic leg and transitions occurred in stance phase when the lead- ing leg was the sound leg. No signiﬁcance was found on mean delay time for the ﬁve subjects (p = 0.785) whichever the leading leg was, which indicated that the proposed method in this article was suitable for these two leading legs as far as the mean delay time were concerned. Third, the method of generating the assistance based on the pre- vious gait cycle time was demonstrated to be reasonable and the tracking performance of the torque could meet the requirement.

E-mail: abraidot@bioingenieria.edu.ar  Abstract— --Squat constitutes one of the most popular exercises to strengthen the muscles of the lower limbs. It is considered one of the most widely spread exercises for muscle sport training and is part of the competition movements comprised within olympic weight-lifting. In physical rehabilitation, squats are used for muscular recovery after different injuries of the lower limbs, especially the knee. In previous anterior cruciate ligament injuries, the mini- squats are generally used, in a knee flexion motion range from 0º to 50º because in this range the shear forces, the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral compression forces decrease related to greater flexion angles. The aim of this work is to make a comparative bidimensional study of the kinematic and dynamic variables of the excecution of the parallel squat exercise with the front and back bar. It is observed in the knee a better development of energy with the front bar, allowing a better muscular exercise with the same load. The mean power absorbed by the hip with the back bar is considerably greater, associated to the speed of the gesture.  1. Introduction","id":"f439f4af-c1b6-4231-8000-cba4de999567"}

IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS  Design and Control of a Novel Active Shoulder Exoskeleton for Overhead Work Assistance  Shuo Ding , Ashwin Narayan , Associate Member, IEEE, Francisco Anaya Reyes , Shuishuai Han , and Haoyong Yu , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—This article presents a novel active shoulder exoskeleton to assist overhead work. The exoskeleton has its actuators, control electronics, and the battery packed in a drive unit located on the user’s back. Bowden cables are used to transmit the forces from the drive unit to the shoulder joints of two lightweight arm support structures. Due to the ﬂexibility of the Bowden cable, the exoskeleton can adapt to complex shoulder joint movements. Linear series elastic actuators are used to achieve force control instead of position control for overhead work assistance. The design speciﬁcations achieve a portable and compliant system. In addition, a multimodal assistive strategy has been developed to handle different working conditions with seamless switching between different modes: free mode with zero torque tracking when no assistance is needed, assist mode during overhead work, and safe mode when a sudden impact load is detected. Experimental studies conducted in simulated overhead work conditions demon- strated the usability and effectiveness of the system. Sta- tistical analysis of the electromyography signals from the key shoulder muscles indicated that the exoskeleton could reduce the level of shoulder muscle activation by up to 40%.

Nuckols1, Louis N. Awad2 and Conor J. Walsh1*  Abstract Background: Ankle-targeting resistance training for improving plantarflexion function during walking increases rehabilitation intensity, an important factor for motor recovery after stroke. However, understanding of the effects of resisting plantarflexion during stance on joint kinetics and muscle activity—key outcomes in evaluating its potential value in rehabilitation—remains limited. This initial study uses a unilateral exosuit that resists plantarflexion during mid-late stance in unimpaired individuals to test the hypotheses that when plantarflexion is resisted, individuals would (1) increase plantarflexor ankle torque and muscle activity locally at the resisted ipsilateral ankle, but (2) at higher forces, exhibit a generalized response that also uses the unresisted joints and limb. Further, we expected (3) short-term retention into gait immediately after removal of resistance. Methods: Ten healthy young adults walked at 1.25 m s− exposure to active exosuit-applied resistance, and post-active sections. In each bout, a different force magnitude was applied based on individual baseline ankle torques. The peak resistance torque applied by the exosuit was 0.13 0.01, 0.19 1 Results: (1) Across all bouts, participants increased peak ipsilateral biological ankle torque by 0.13–0.25 N m kg− (p < 0.001) during exosuit-applied resistance compared to corresponding baselines. Additionally, ipsilateral soleus activity during stance increased by 5.4–11.3% (p < 0.05) in all but the LOW bout. (2) In the HIGH and MAX bouts, vertical ground reaction force decreased on the ipsilateral limb while increasing on the contralateral limb (p < 0.01). Secondary analysis found that the force magnitude that maximized increases in biological ankle torque without significant changes in limb loading varied by subject. (3) Finally, peak ipsilateral plantarflexion angle increased signifi- cantly during post-exposure in the intermediate HIGH resistance bout (p < 0.05), which corresponded to the greatest average increase in soleus activity (p > 0.10).  1 for four 10-min discrete bouts, each comprising baseline,  1, in the LOW, MED, HIGH, and MAX bouts, respectively.","id":"1ceb4abc-4918-4cf8-bb0a-23f25814e833"}

Long, Siyuan Feng, H. Benjamin Brown, Robert D. Gregg, Member, IEEE, Howie Choset, Matthew T. Mason, Fellow, IEEE, and Kevin M. Lynch, Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—The ParkourBot climbs in a planar reduced-gravity vertical chute by leaping back and forth between the chute’s two parallel walls. The ParkourBot is comprised of a body with two springy legs and its controls consist of leg angles at touchdown and the energy stored in them. During ﬂight, the robot stores elastic potential energy in its springy legs and then converts this poten- tial energy in to kinetic energy at touchdown, when it “kicks off” a wall. This paper describes the ParkourBot’s mechanical design, modeling, and open-loop climbing experiments. The mechanical design makes use of the BowLeg, previously used for hopping on a ﬂat ground. We introduce two models of the BowLeg ParkourBot: one is based on a nonzero stance duration using the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, and the other is a simpliﬁed model (the simplest parkour model, or SPM) obtained as the leg stiffness ap- proaches inﬁnity and the stance time approaches zero. The SPM approximation provides the advantage of closed-form calculations. Finally, predictions of the models are validated by experiments in open-loop climbing in a reduced-gravity planar environment pro- vided by an air table.

Equinus is common in children with cerebral palsy; as such, children ages 5-12 are the intended users of the device. Equinus is a condition in which the patient’s ankle motion is restricted. As a result, gait becomes awkward and inefficient, and the propulsive force a typical human body would receive from ankle motion is significantly reduced or lost completely. Patients with equinus tend to develop detrimental gait patterns, most notably toe-walking. Improving their gait with an assistive device should help these patients manage their condition.  The goal of improving gait was accomplished by designing an exoskeleton device that provided an assistive propulsive force to the patient’s foot. To begin the design process, customer needs were outlined, based on requirements and specifications provided by the client, Dr. Zachary Lerner (the director of NAU’s Biomechatronics Lab). Engineering requirements were then developed to meet the customer needs. Primary requirements included the use of a Bowden cable system to provide propulsion, adjustability of the device for a range of equinus severity, a need for reduced weight, and a minimum torque applied at the foot.

We present the design and control of a multimodal locomotion robotic platform called LEONARDO, which bridges the gap between two different loco- motion regimes of flying and walking using synchronized control of distributed electric thrusters and a pair of multijoint legs. By combining two distinct locomotion mechanisms, LEONARDO achieves complex maneuvers that require delicate balancing, such as walking on a slackline and skateboarding, which are challenging for existing bipedal robots. LEONARDO also demonstrates agile walking motions, interlaced with flying maneuvers to over- come obstacles using synchronized control of propellers and leg joints. The mechanical design and synchronized control strategy achieve a unique multimodal locomotion capability that could potentially enable robotic missions and operations that would be difficult for single-modal locomotion robots.","id":"8b496de6-9df5-49c0-be53-ad1f557c6468"}

Speciﬁcally, the control strategy uses an extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) that fuses angle and velocity measurements from the hip, knee, and ankle joints to estimate the phase and its rate of change. The control strategy then uses these estimates as inputs into Gaussian Process (GP) functions that specify the desired angles, velocities, and feed-forward torques for the knee and ankle joints. These control surfaces are designed to appropriately adapt to speed variations and transitions to standing. We compare this proposed GP-EKF control strategy to both a neuromuscular control (NM) strategy and an impedance control (IMP) strategy in experiments with able-bodied subjects and an amputee subject. We ﬁnd that GP-EKF control generates sig- niﬁcantly more natural knee behavior but slightly less natural ankle behavior than both NM or IMP control. In addition, we ﬁnd in experiments with the subjects stepping on blocks during stance that the GP-EKF control resulted in signiﬁcantly fewer falls than IMP control. Finally, we evaluate the ability of the proposed control to track phase across varying treadmill speeds including sudden stops, and ﬁnd that the EKF’s phase estimate tracks these gait changes signiﬁcantly better than a time-based phase estimate. The proposed control strategy may provide a robust and adaptive control alternative for powered transfemoral prostheses.  relies on the detection of gait events, such as joint angles crossing thresholds, to trigger phase transitions that may cause abrupt changes in torque output as well as unreliable responses to gait disturbances.","id":"7d6b6999-dd15-43fb-a370-e93e99aa4294"}

In this paper, we present a new version of autonomous multi-joint soft exosuit for gait assistance, particularly designed for overground walking. The soft exosuit assists with ankle plantarflexion, hip flexion, and hip extension, equally distributing the forces between ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion. A mobile actuation system was developed to generate high assistive forces, and Bowden cables are used to transmit the forces to the exosuit. A sensor harness connects two load cells and three IMUs per leg that are used to measure real-time data for a controller that commands desired force profiles as a function of the walking cycle. In addition, a control adaptation method was developed which adjusts control parameters while walking on irregular surfaces. In preliminary studies, the proposed method substantially improved the force consistency while walking over uneven terrain. Specifically, the number of steps where the peak force deviated from the target force decreased from 100 to 57 out of 250 steps, and RMS error on the peak force decreased from 90.0 N to 76.6 N with respect to 300 N target force. Also, a two-subject case study on country-course walking demonstrated the potential of this soft exosuit to improve human energy economy while walking overground. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, lower-limb wearable devices have been developed to assist with human walking. Applications of these devices include assisting individuals with disabilities to relieve their gait deficits [1-2] and augmenting healthy people to improve the energy economy during walking [3-5] or load carriage [6-7]. Conventionally these devices have consisted of rigid structures which enables to deliver high assistive torques to the wearer and to transfer carried load directly to the ground [7]. However, when misaligned with the wearer’s biological joints, the rigid frames may restrict the natural motion of the wearer and apply undesired forces [7-8]. Moreover, rigid structures may add large inertia to the wearer’s lower limb, which is associated with increased energy expenditure during walking [9]. This material is based upon the work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Warrior Web Program (Contract No. W911NF-14-C-0051), the Samsung Scholarship, and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (Grant No. DGE1144152)","id":"0b95fd57-fac8-4a05-b2f3-a49214dadcfe"}

However, existing assist devices pose problems in terms of coordination between the person and the device owing to misalignment of motion time or device motion trajectory. Therefore, an assist method with a wide range of tolerance for such misalignment is required. In a previous study focusing on viscosity characteristics, the basic assist effect of viscosity in seated motion was verified and its effectiveness was demonstrated. Consequently, the viscosity command was able to provide assistance with a wider range of tolerance for movement time and misalignment between the motion trajectory of the device and the wearer than other command methods. This study examines the assist effect of variable viscosity control in stair descent, which is a complex and cyclic knee joint motion. Experiments were conducted to compare the command signals of the variable viscosity command (proposed method) that adjusts torque based on angular velocity, time command, which modifies the output value over time, and angle command, which alters the command value according to the angle of the device. In addition, a subjective evaluation experiment was conducted using a questionnaire. The results confirmed that the variable viscosity command can accommodate a wider range of tolerance for time deviation and deviation of the motion trajectory of both the person and the device compared to other command methods. I. INTRODUCTION Wearable assist devices are directly attached to a person; therefore, it is important that they synchronize seamlessly with the movements of the wearer. Ideally, similar to human muscles, assist devices should be driven voluntarily. However, accurately reading and driving the intention of the wearer is challenging. Existing assist devices do not drive voluntarily but often output preprogrammed commands based on the information obtained from sensors or perform feedback control using sensor information from the device. However, it is difficult for the wearer to operate the assist device as expected when it is driven by preprogrammed commands based on sensor information. In addition, a discrepancy exists between the expected and actual operations. In the case of feedback control using sensor information from the device, achieving perfect alignment between motion trajectories of the device and the wearer is challenging, resulting in misalignment. This misalignment poses a coordination problem that is difficult to eliminate completely","id":"4a537cce-e886-4562-b898-cfd156f1991b"}

The effort to perform a squat can decrease using an exoskeleton that considers individual worker’s differences and assists them with a customized solution, namely, personalized assistance. Designing such an exoskeleton could be improved by understanding how the user’s muscle activity changes when assistance is provided. This study investigated the change in the muscle recruitment and activation pattern when personalized assistance was provided. The personalized assistance was provided by an ankle–foot exoskeleton during squatting and we compared its effect with that of the no-device and unpowered exoskeleton conditions using previously collected data. We identified four main muscle recruitment strategies across ten participants. One of the strategies mainly used quadriceps muscles, and the activation level corresponding to the strategy was reduced under exoskeleton assistance compared to the no-device and unpowered conditions. These quadriceps dominant synergy and rectus femoris activations showed reasonable correlations (r = 0.65, 0.59) to the metabolic cost of squatting. These results indicate that the assistance helped reduce quadriceps activation, and thus, the metabolic cost of squatting. These outcomes suggest that the muscle recruitment and activation patterns could be used to design an exoskeleton and training methods.","id":"412fc10b-32bb-4e3a-b7bb-dd726ae3ffc2"}

Scherpereel*, Dean D. Molinaro, Max K. Shepherd, Omer T. Inan, and Aaron J. Young  Abstract— Objective: Real-time measurement of biological joint moment could enhance clinical assessments and generalize exoskeleton control. Accessing joint moments outside clinical and laboratory settings requires harnessing non-invasive wearable sensor data for indirect estimation. Previous approaches have been primarily validated during cyclic tasks, such as walking, but these methods are likely limited when translating to non-cyclic tasks where the mapping from kinematics to moments is not unique. Methods: We trained deep learning models to estimate hip and sensors, electromyography (EMG), and simulated pressure insoles from a dataset including 10 cyclic and 18 non-cyclic activities. We assessed estimation error on combinations of sensor modalities during both activity types. Results: Compared to the kinematics- only baseline, adding EMG reduced RMSE by 16.9% at the hip and 30.4% at the knee (p<0.05) and adding insoles reduced RMSE by 21.7% at the hip and 33.9% at the knee (p<0.05). Adding both modalities reduced RMSE by 32.5% at the hip and 41.2% at the knee (p<0.05) which was significantly higher than either modality individually (p<0.05). All sensor additions improved model performance on non-cyclic tasks more than cyclic tasks (p<0.05). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that adding kinetic sensor information through EMG or insoles improves joint moment estimation both individually and jointly. These additional modalities are most important during non-cyclic tasks, tasks that reflect the variable and sporadic nature of the real-world. Significance: Improved joint moment estimation and task generalization is pivotal to developing wearable robotic systems capable of enhancing mobility in everyday life.  knee  joint moments  from  kinematic  Index Terms— deep learning, electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement units (IMUs), joint temporal  human kinetics, moments, machine convolutional network  learning, pressure  insoles,  I.

Consequently, in the field of wearable robotics, there is a clear need for customizing assistance to the user and task. Here, we developed a muscle-based assistance (MBA) strategy wherein exosuit assistance was derived from direct mea- surements of individuals’ muscle dynamics during specific tasks. We recorded individuals’ soleus muscle dynam- ics using ultrasonographic imaging during multiple walking speeds and inclines. From these prerecorded images, we estimated the force produced by the soleus through inefficient concentric contraction and designed the exo- suit assistance profile to be proportional to that estimated force. We evaluated this approach with a bilateral ankle exosuit at each measured walking task. Compared with not wearing a device, the MBA ankle exosuit significantly −1 , reduced metabolic demand by an average of 15.9, 9.7, and 8.9% for level walking at 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 meters second at 5.71° incline while applying lower assistance levels than in existing respectively, and 7.8% at 1.25 meters second literature. In an additional study (n = 2), we showed for multiple walking tasks that the MBA profile outperforms other bioinspired strategies and the average profile from a previous optimization study. Last, we show the feasibility of online assistance generation in a mobile version for overground outdoor walking. This muscle-based approach enables relatively rapid (~10 seconds) generation of individualized low-force assistance profiles that provide metabolic benefit. This approach may help support the adoption of wearable robotics in real-world, dynamic locomotor tasks by enabling comfortable, tailored, and adaptive assistance.  −1","id":"1cb8cfd4-960f-425c-ae14-3a66e510aea6"}

Martin1, Ricardo Reyes1, and Steven H. Collins1  1Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University  Exoskeletons that assist the hip, knee, and ankle joints have be- gun to improve human mobility, particularly by reducing the metabolic cost of walking. However, direct comparisons of op- timal assistance of these joints, or their combinations, have not yet been possible. Assisting multiple joints may be more bene- ﬁcial than the sum of individual effects, because muscles often span multiple joints, or less effective, because single-joint as- sistance can indirectly aid other joints. In this study, we used a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton emulator paired with human-in-the- loop optimization to ﬁnd single-joint, two-joint, and whole-leg assistance that maximally reduced the metabolic cost of walk- ing for three participants. Hip-only and ankle-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 26% and 30% relative to walking in the device unassisted, conﬁrming that both joints are good targets for assistance. Knee-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 13%, demonstrating that ef- fective knee assistance is possible. Two-joint assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by between 34% and 42%, with the largest improvements coming from hip-ankle assistance. As- sisting all three joints reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 50%, showing that at least half of the metabolic energy ex- pended during walking can be saved through exoskeleton as- sistance. Changes in kinematics and muscle activity indicate that single-joint assistance indirectly assisted muscles at other joints, such that the improvement from whole-leg assistance was smaller than the sum of its single-joint parts. Exoskeletons can assist the entire limb for maximum effect, but a single well- chosen joint can be more efﬁcient when considering additional factors such as weight and cost.

Wearable technologies can be used to help monitor a patients progress in and adherence to their rehabilitation pro- tocols. Further, estimating joint angles can help medical professionals treat their patients effectively. In this paper, we propose three models that can be used in succession to calculate knee angles from voltage.

From 1999 to 2011, a study of more than 6.5 million knee injuries in the United States revealed that nearly 50% of the knee injuries were sports related with adolescents making up an estimated 2.5 million sports related knee injuries annually [2]. In the senior population, knee injuries are common due to falling and diseases such as osteoarthritis.

It is designed to capture and store 20% of the biomechanical energy dissipated at the biological knee joint during decent phase and return the harnessed energy in the ascent phase in a squatting cycle. The effectiveness of the proposed system was verified by evaluating performance of key muscles of knee joint using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. Statistical data from experiments revealed a reduction of peak root-mean-square averages of sEMG signals of knee extensor muscles by 30 - 40% during squatting.

However, the performance of traditional deep learning mod- els is limited by the depth of networks, which is directly related to the training consumption. In addition, the pa- rameters of networks can only be updated by retraining when faced with newly acquired data. To address the above problems, an incremental learning method based on a tem- poral cascade broad learning system (TCBLS) is proposed for the RUL prediction of machinery with newly acquired data. Speciﬁcally, linear and nonlinear feature information is ﬁrst learned by the TCBLS. The ridge regression method is developed to calculate the weights of the network and establish an end-to-end mapping between the feature in- formation layer and the prediction layer. Finally, the incre- mental learning of new data and the incremental learning of nodes are proposed for adaptively updating the weights of the network in the face of newly acquired data and insufﬁcient prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is veriﬁed by four run-to-failure datasets. The comparison results with classical deep learning mod- els show that the proposed method is promising for RUL prediction as it achieves high prediction accuracy while saving training time consumption across orders of magni- tude and effectively handling newly acquired data without retraining.

Robotic capacity to intelligently adapt to human force, however, demands a fusion of data from exoskeleton and user state for smooth human-robot syn- ergy. Muscle activity, mapped through electromyography (EMG) or mechanomyography (MMG) is widely acknowledged as usable sensor input that precedes the onset of human joint torque. How- ever, competing and complementary information between such physiological feedback is yet to be exploited, or even assessed, for predictive LLE control. We investigate complementary and com- peting beneﬁts of EMG and MMG sensing modalities as a means of calculating human torque input for assist-as-needed (AAN) LLEcontrol.Threebiomechanicallyagnosticmachinelearningap- proaches, linear regression, polynomial regression, and neural net- works, are implemented for joint torque prediction during human- exoskeleton interaction experiments. Results demonstrate MMG predicts human joint torque with slightly lower accuracy than EMGforisometrichuman-exoskeletoninteraction.Performanceis comparable for dynamic exercise.

Modern control strategies for wearable robots are predicated on activity-speciﬁc implementations, and testing is usually limited to a single, ﬁxed activity within the laboratory (e.g., level ground walking). To accommodate various activities in real- world scenarios, control strategies mustinclude theability tosafely andseamlesslytransitionbetweenactivity-speciﬁccontrollers.One potential solution to this challenge is to the infer wearer’s intent using pattern recognition of locomotion sensor data. To this end, we developed an intent recognition framework implementing con- volutional neural networks with image encoding (i.e. spectrogram) that enables prediction of the upcoming locomotor activity of the wearer’s next step. In this letter, we describe our intent recog- nition system, comprised of a mel-spectrogram and subsequent neural network architecture. In addition, we analyzed the effect of sensor locations and modalities on the recognition system, and compared our proposed system to state-of-the-art locomotor intent recognition strategies.

In this paper, we propose a myoelectric controller for a robotic transtib- ial prosthesis to realize adaptive slope walking. It works together with the intrinsic controller, enabling amputee users to pay rela- tively less attention on myoelectric control during walking. Am- putee users convey the information of ground slope to prostheses by consciously performing dorsiﬂexion and plantar ﬂexion of the “phantom ankle” with different intensities at the beginning of the swing phase. Two channels of surface electromyographic signals are measured from the residual shank, and they are mapped to the inclination angle of the slope. Control parameters of the in- trinsic controller are then calculated according to the estimated inclination angle. In this preliminary study, two transtibial am- putee subjects were recruited. They were asked to convey six tar- geted inclination angles ( ± 5◦, ±10◦, and ±15◦) to the prosthesis with the trained myoelectric controller during level-ground walk- ing, and satisfactory control performance was achieved.

Therefore, improving the intuitiveness of interaction between users and prostheses and realizing adaptive walking to terrain changes are important issues for lower-limb prosthesis control.","id":"c5e091b5-7b4e-423a-81a8-10f68e9ea169"}

Keya Ghonasgi, Jiyeon Kang, and Sunil K. Agrawal*  Abstract— In a previous study, a Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) was used to successfully retrain crouch gait of children with Cerebral Palsy by applying a downward force on the pelvis during walking on a treadmill. While the results of this study were promising, an important issue was translating these results to special needs children with crouch gait using simpler alternative procedures. This motivates the present study to compare the biomechanical differences in walking under two conditions: (i) the TPAD applies a pure downward force on the pelvis using tethers, and (ii) a weighted pelvic belt is used to apply the same downward force on the pelvis. In the second case the weight belt also increases the mass at the pelvis.  Ten healthy subjects performed two separate experiments while walking on an instrumented treadmill. The whole-body kinematics was recorded using a motion capture system and the ground reaction forces were measured by force plates embedded in the treadmill. We found no significant difference in the actual gait parameters of healthy subjects when the downwards force, equivalent to 15% body weight, applied by the TPAD was replaced by a weighted pelvic belt of 15% body weight. However, the estimated maximum ankle torque, predicted by an inverted pendulum mathematical model, during the single support phase showed a higher increase during walking with the weight belt when compared to a pure downward force. This suggests that the weight belt, due to its simplicity, may be a better medium to translate the results of TPAD in children with cerebral palsy who have a crouch gait.  I. INTRODUCTION Human walking has been studied extensively over the years. Simplified inverted pendulum models have been proposed to predict the human gait and estimate stability using the Zero Moment Point [1]. However, it is still a challenge to satisfactorily predict walking under different experimental conditions.  vertical direction and propulsion of Inertial Mass (IM) in the direction of progression, are of particular interest during a gait cycle. These tasks have been studied in the past and are summarized in the following paragraphs.","id":"bfe58503-2136-4faf-a71a-1b7e2610b580"}

Panizzolo1,2, Kenneth G. Holt5 and Conor J. Walsh1,2*  , Sangjun Lee1,2, Simona Crea4, Christopher Siviy1,2, Fabricio Saucedo1,2, Ignacio Galiana1,2,  Abstract  Background: Only very recently, studies have shown that it is possible to reduce the metabolic rate of unloaded and loaded walking using robotic ankle exoskeletons. Some studies obtained this result by means of high positive work assistance while others combined negative and positive work assistance. There is no consensus about the isolated contribution of negative work assistance. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to examine the effect of varying negative work assistance at the ankle joint while maintaining a fixed level of positive work assistance with a multi-articular soft exosuit. Methods: We tested eight participants during walking at 1.5 ms−1 with a 23-kg backpack. Participants wore a version of the exosuit that assisted plantarflexion via Bowden cables tethered to an off-board actuation platform. In four active conditions we provided different rates of exosuit bilateral ankle negative work assistance ranging from 0. 015 to 0.037 W kg−1 and a fixed rate of positive work assistance of 0.19 W kg−1. Results: All active conditions significantly reduced metabolic rate by 11 to 15% compared to a reference condition, where the participants wore the exosuit but no assistance was provided. We found no significant effect of negative work assistance. However, there was a trend (p = .08) toward greater reduction in metabolic rate with increasing negative work assistance, which could be explained by observed reductions in biological ankle and hip joint power and moment.  Conclusions: The non-significant trend of increasing negative work assistance with increasing reductions in metabolic rate motivates the value in further studies on the relative effects of negative and positive work assistance. There may be benefit in varying negative work over a greater range or in isolation from positive work assistance.","id":"9ed49892-ed7f-44d8-9ee0-ada434ada421"}

Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009;90: 136-44.  Objectives: To test the hypothesis that reducing vertical center of mass (COM) displacement will lower the metabolic cost of human walking. To examine changes in joint work associated with increasing and decreasing vertical COM move- ment during gait.  Design: Randomized repeated measures. Setting: Human Neuromechanics Laboratory, University of  Michigan.  Participants: Able-bodied subjects (N10). Interventions: Subjects walked at 1.2m\/s on a treadmill and overground. Subjects manipulated vertical COM displacement either by adjusting stride length or by using visual feedback to reduce COM movement.  Main Outcome Measures: We measured kinematic and kinetic data to calculate vertical and lateral COM displace- ments, joint torques, and work. In addition, we collected oxy- gen consumption to calculated metabolic power.  Results: Increasing and decreasing vertical COM displace- ment beyond subjects’ preferred range resulted in increases in the metabolic cost of walking. When vertical COM displace- ment was reduced, corresponding increases in positive ankle and hip work and negative knee work were observed.  Conclusions: Humans are capable of walking in a manner that will reduce COM displacement from normal. Decreasing vertical COM movement results in increases in metabolic en- ergy costs because of greater mechanical work performed at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Thus, reducing vertical COM movement is not a successful strategy for improving either metabolic or mechanical energy economy during normal walk- ing by able-bodied subjects.","id":"dbf013c0-0eb4-46b3-9f71-1f84e0e5f252"}

Advances in robotic hardware and energy supplies have enabled viable prototypes for human testing. This review paper describes current lower limb robotic exoskeletons, with speciﬁc regard to common trends in the ﬁeld. The preponderance of published literature lacks rigorous quanti- tative evaluations of exoskeleton performance, making it difﬁcult to determine the disadvantages and drawbacks of many of the devices. We analyzed common approaches in exoskeleton design and the convergence, or lack thereof, with certain technologies. We focused on actuators, sensors, energy sources, materials, and control strategies. One of the largest hurdles to be overcome in exoskeleton research is the user interface and control. More intuitive and ﬂexible user interfaces are needed to increase the success of robotic exoskeletons. In the last section, we discuss promising future solutions to the major hurdles in exoskeleton control.

We introduced a new reinforcement learning (RL) controller for this purpose based on the promising ability of RL controllers to solve optimal control problems through interactions with the environment without requiring an explicit system model. However, collecting data from a human-prosthesis system is expensive and thus the design of a RL controller has to take into account data and time efﬁciency. We therefore propose an ofﬂine policy iteration based reinforcement learning approach. Our solution is built on the ﬁnite state machine (FSM) impedance control framework, which is the most used prosthesis control method in commercial and prototypic robotic prosthesis. Under such a framework, we designed an approximate policy iteration algorithm to devise impedance parameter update rules for 12 prosthesis control parameters in order to meet individual users’ needs. The goal of the reinforcement learning-based control was to reproduce near-normal knee kinematics during gait. We tested the RL controller obtained from ofﬂine learning in real time experiment involving the same able-bodied human subject wearing a robotic lower limb prosthesis. Our results showed that the RL control resulted in good convergent behavior in kinematic states, and the ofﬂine learning control policy successfully adjusted the prosthesis control parameters to produce near-normal knee kinematics in 10 updates of the impedance control parameters.","id":"dd7a0f3b-e6bf-401a-bc73-ae85eb2d67ba"}

INTRODUCTION Many people wish to perform at a high level while playing an active role in sports. Interest in enabling the disabled and the elderly to participate in sports has increased in recent years. Universal sports and superhuman sports that enable everyone to play in the same competition regardless of the presence or absence of a disability, age difference, or gender has also attracted increased attention. However, to be active in sports, it is necessary for players to condition their physical capability and technique with daily training. Active motion assist devices are currently being actively developed. These devices are of two types: active type [1-3], which is equipped with actuators; and passive type [4-6], which uses spring elements. In the active type, it is necessary to mount an energy source (for example, a battery, a compressed gas tank, or a compressor) that drives the actuator while achieving a strong assisting force by the actuator and performing fine control. This makes the overall system bulky and heavy, and also incurs high maintenance costs. The passive type is inexpensive and lightweight. However, the assist power generated by current passive assist devices is not sufficiently large to aid participants in sports. Further, the spring elements sometimes disrupt the wearer’s motion because they always generate force, and provide resistive force in certain cases","id":"c3c895c8-7ae1-4b34-a8e9-e9390627b1c2"}

However, no studies have investigated how quickly individuals with neuromuscular disabilities adapt to assistance across different time scales, which makes experimental design challenging. The goal of this case series was to evaluate how individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) adapt to untethered powered plantar-flexor assistance within and across exoskeleton practice sessions. To assess inter-visit adaptation, one participant with mild CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level (GMFCS) I) completed 112 minutes of exoskeleton walking practice across four visits. This participant’s preferred level of assistance increased across practice sessions, and metabolic assessment indicated reduced acclimation time and improved walking economy; across visits, metabolic cost decreased by 18% during walking with exoskeleton assistance and by 13% while wearing the exoskeleton in an unassisted condition. To assess intra-visit adaptation, another participant with mild CP (GMFCS I) completed three 8-10 minute exoskeleton-assisted walking trials with the same level of assistance on a single visit. This participant exhibited a 16% reduction in the average metabolic cost relative to baseline during the final minute of walking on the third trial. Despite walking with assistance for 30 minutes, the participant did not appear to reach a fully acclimated state at the end of the third trial, suggesting that further improvements may have been observed with additional practice. These preliminary findings may prove useful for designing novel intervention studies and experimental protocols testing the potential benefit of wearable assistance in clinical populations. I. INTRODUCTION Neuromuscular deficits, including those caused by stroke, spinal cord injury, and cerebral palsy (CP), often result in impaired walking ability [1], [2]. Abnormal gait patterns caused by these conditions increase the energy required to walk and are associated with reduced levels of physical activity [3]–[5]. Techniques to improve walking efficiency have the potential to drastically improve the quality of life in these patient populations, particularly for CP, which is a child-onset condition with symptoms that typically worsen with age.

The following research discusses the posthuman subject in contemporary times, focusing on prosthetic applications to deliberate how the disabled body is empowered through prosthetic enhancement and cultural representations. The disability market both intersects and transcends race, religion, and gender; the promise of technology bettering the human condition is its ultimate product. Bionic technology, in particular, is a burgeoning ﬁeld; our engineering skills already show promise of a future where physical impediment will be almost obsolete. I aim to cross-examine empowering marketing images and phrases embedded in cinema and media that emphasize how disability becomes super-ability with prosthetic enhancement. Though the beneﬁts of biotechnology are most empowering to the disabled population, further scrutiny raises a number of paradoxical questions exposed by the market’s advance. With all these tools at our disposal, why is it that the disabled have yet to reap the rewards? How are disabled bodies, biotechnology, and posthuman possibilities commodiﬁed and commercialized? Most importantly, what impact will this have on our society? This paper exempliﬁes empowering and inclusive messages emphasized in disabled representation, as well as raising bioethical concerns that fuel the ongoing debate of the technological haves and have-nots. Furthermore, this paper challenges the ideals of normative bodies while depicting the disabledasanopen, embodiedsitewheretechnology, corporeality, andsociologyinteract.

Goldfarb 混合FES系统 髋膝关节耦合控制","content":"Abstract—This paper proposes a new configuration for a hybrid-FES gait restoration system, and presents a combination of simulation and experiment that support the feasibility of the proposed approach. Gait simulation results are presented that indicate the majority of load bearing and the majority of power for gait is provided by the legs (i.e., quadriceps muscle stimulation). Based on these simulations, experiments on healthy subjects indicate that the gait restoration approach should be capable of providing long periods of locomotion unimpeded by quadriceps muscle fatigue. I. INTRODUCTION REVIOUS studies have demonstrated that functional electrical stimulation (FES) can be used for restoring gait to people with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Standing and walking can provide significant physiological and psychological benefits to those with SCI [1-9]. However, electrically stimulated muscles suffer from rapid fatigue [10], relatively poor controllability of stimulated muscles, and the inability to control degrees-of-freedom outside the sagittal plane. Hybrid systems, which combine FES with an orthosis, can address several of the shortcomings of FES-aided gait. Use of an orthosis reduces the duty cycle of muscle stimulation during stance, reduce the complexity of gait by imposing kinematic constraints, and enables closed-loop control of electrically stimulated muscle by providing a mounting platform for joint angle sensors. Recent research in hybrid FES gait restoration systems using surface and implanted electrodes include [11-15] and [16-18], respectively. This paper assesses the feasibility of a hybrid FES system that is different from others previously reported ([11-18]). The approach uses modulated brakes at the hip and knee joints (like [11-15]), unidirectional joint coupling between knee and hip flexion, and a biasing spring that biases the knee joint, and via coupling the hip joint, toward a flexed position. The device is called the Joint Couple Orthosis (JCO). Due to the joint coupling and biasing, a swing-through gait can be generated utilizing only surface stimulation of the quadriceps group of each leg (i.e., one stimulation channel per leg). The orthosis is an energetically passive device because all the power for gait comes from the user’s metabolic power supply, which enhances the physiological benefit for the user and also minimizes the battery requirements for the orthosis.

A representative dataset for training data-driven models is crucial to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. However, the acquisition of sufﬁcient data is time-consuming and often infeasible. We present a method to create realistic inertial sensor data with corresponding biomechanical variables by 2D walking and running simulations. We augmented a measured inertial sensor dataset with simulated data for the training of convolutional neural networks to estimate sagittal plane joint angles, joint moments, and ground reaction forces (GRFs) of walking and running. When adding simulated data, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the test set of hip, knee, and ankle joint angles decreased up to 17%, 27% and 23%, the RMSE of knee and ankle joint moments up to 6% and the RMSE of anterior-posterior and vertical GRF up to 2and 6%. Simulation-aided estimation of joint moments and GRFs was limited by inaccuracies of the biomechanical model. Improving the physics-based model and domain adaptation learning may further increase the beneﬁt of simulated data. Future work can exploit biomechanical simulations to connect different data sources in order to create representative datasets of human movement.

One is the rotor and air gap, and the other is the stator. The rotor and gap are uniform in their construction, and one can solve Maxwell’s Equations to derive an essentially exact analysis of their magnetic behaviors. The stator is much more intricate with teeth, slots, and wedges that stick into the slots from the teeth at the air gap. The stator also tends to saturate, whereas the rotor does not. It is not feasible to analyze the stator by analytically solving Maxwell’s Equations due to both geometric complexity and nonlinearity.  Fig. 1. Explanation of Approach.  One approach to analyzing the machine is Finite Element Analysis (FEA) which carries the expense of computation time. It requires a ﬁne mesh at least in the stator to capture its ge- ometrical intricacies. FEA is inappropriate for the rotor since the rotor can be effectively analyzed by an explicit solution of Maxell’s Equations. One could also analyze the stator using a nonlinear ﬂux tube analysis. This is an approximation, but not a bad one if attention is paid to geometric details.  Our approach is to analytically solve Maxwell’s Equations for each space harmonic in the rotor and airgap and to use a ﬂux tube analysis for the stator. Each analysis is appropriate for its own region, and quite fast compared to FEA.

ACCEPTED JUNE, 2022 1 Abstract— The widespread adoption of powered lower-limb exoskeletons for augmenting mobility requires energy-efficient actuation to provide meaningful assistance over relevant walking durations. We designed, modeled, and validated an ankle exoskeleton design with a parallel elastic element in the form of a carbon fiber leaf spring that stored and returned energy in parallel to a cable-drive ankle joint during stance phase. We assessed the impact of the parallel elastic element on the performance of the untethered robotic ankle exoskeleton at walking speeds of 0.75-1.25 m\/s using a previously validated-controller, and a controller designed specifically to maximize the spring’s benefit. The spring selected for our adult cohort had a stiffness of 97.2 Nm\/rad, engaged best at 0-degrees ankle dorsiflexion, and produced 10-15 Nm peak assistive torque at all walking speeds. When tracking the previously validated exoskeleton controller, peak motor current was reduced by 14-20% and integrated current was reduced by 16-19% for parallel-elastic design vs. without spring engagement; this translated to 15-26% more assisted steps for the same battery capacity. When utilizing the controller designed to take advantage of the parallel spring torque, the number of assisted steps for the same battery capacity increased 46-76% compared to the no spring configuration depending on walking speed. Seeking to facilitate real-world adoption, this powered parallel elastic ankle exoskeleton design holds potential to significantly extend powered walking duration, and improve battery and motor life of operation by reducing peak and mean motor current requirements.

Stair climbing under backpack load condition is a challenging task. Understanding muscle activation patterns of lower limb during stair climbing with load furthers our understanding of the factors involved in joint pathology and the effects of treatment. At the same time, stair climbing under backpack load requires adjustments of muscle activations and increases joint moment compared to level walking, which with muscle activation patterns are altered as a result of using an assistive technology, such as a wearable exoskeleton leg for human walking power augmentation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze lower limb muscles during stair climbing under different backpack load. Nine healthy volunteers ascended a four-step staircase at different backpack load (0 kg, 10 kg, 20 kg, 30 kg). Electromyographic (EMG) signals were recorded from four lower limb muscles (gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, hamstring, rectus femo- ris). The results showed that muscle activation amplitudes of lower limb increase with increasing load during stair climbing, the maxi- mum RMS of gastrocnemius are greater than tibialis anterior, hamstring and rectus femoris whether stair climbing or level walking under the same load condition. However, the maximum RMS of hamstring are smaller than gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and rectus femoris. The study of muscle activation under different backpack load during stair climbing can be used to design biomechanism and explore intelligent control based on EMG for a wearable exoskeleton leg for human walking power augmentation.

Young Ph.D.  Abstract— Despite there being studies that have investigated the effects of human augmentation using a knee exoskeleton, comparing different assistance schemes on a single knee exoskeleton has not been studied. Using a light-weight, low- profile bilateral knee exoskeleton system, this study examined and compared the biomechanical effects of three common assistance strategies impedance, and proportional myoelectric controllers) exhibiting different levels of flexibility for the user to control the assistance. Nine subjects walked on a 15% gradient incline surface at 1.1 m\/s in the three powered conditions and with the exoskeleton unpowered. All the assistance strategies significantly reduced the metabolic cost of the users compared to the unpowered condition by 3.0% on average across strategies (p < 0.05), led by the significant reduction in the biological knee kinetic effort and knee extensor muscle activation (p < 0.05). Between assistance strategies, the metabolic cost and biomechanics displayed no statistically significant differences. The metabolic and biomechanical results indicate that powered extension assistance during early stance can improve performance compared to the unpowered condition. However, the user’s ability to control the assistance may not be significant for human augmentation when walking on an inclined surface with a knee exoskeleton.

To identify the correct timing of giving assistive torques during the stair climbing process, integrating with a lower limb dynamic model with the foot-force measured data is a common way to derive the knee joint torque profile for gait analysis. However, this estimation method which requires the installation of pressure sensors on the sole of the feet has drawbacks including the inconvenience of exoskeleton wearing and increased moving difficulty. The fact that stair climbing is a sequential movement thus allows us to apply a recurrent neural network to obtain the relationship between the knee joint muscular torque and lower limb gait. Stair climbing experiments on a knee exoskeleton wearer reveal that the trained neural network is able to perform the desired knee joint torque estimation whose results can be applied to derive proper assistive torques in the presence of human-robot interaction.","id":"8dfa97e9-f028-4a1a-9c5a-e65c8308972f"}

The use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) in joint moment estimation has drawn considerable attention. Minimizing the number of IMUs deployed on the lower-limb and simplifying the application procedure have long been the pressing problem to be solved during the accurate estimation of multiple joint moments in multiple scenarios. In the present study, the performance of seven different deep-learning models, including the proposed attention-based conventional neural network- bidirectional long short-term memory model and six previous-published typical deep-learning models, were compared in predicting the sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle joint moments during the most representative locomotive activities. A public dataset was employed to train and validate these models. Seven configurations of IMUs, including different placement and number of IMUs, were evaluated to explore the influence of IMU setup on the performance of the proposed model. Of all seven deep-learning models, best performance was achieved using the proposed model. Pearson correlation coefficient derived from the proposed model using a single IMU attached on the shank, foot, and thigh reached up to 0.85, 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. Shank is the optimal location for attaching a single IMU for the moment prediction of all three joints, while extra IMUs attached elsewhere failed to derive pronounced benefit for improving the estimation accuracy. Thus, even using a single shank-worn IMU, the proposed model is still capable of accurately estimating the joint moments of lower-limbs.  1. Introduction","id":"7a59cb75-71bb-4049-9107-e5fec6c90ef5"}

First published January 6, 2011; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.00505.2010.—Muscles expend energy to perform active work during locomotion, but they may also expend signiﬁcant energy to produce force, for example when tendons perform much of the work passively. The relative contribu- tions of work and force to overall energy expenditure are unknown. We therefore measured the mechanics and energetics of a cyclical bouncing task, designed to control for work and force. We hypothe- sized that near bouncing resonance, little work would be performed actively by muscle, but the cyclical production of force would cost substantial metabolic energy. Human subjects (n  9) bounced vertically about the ankles at inversely proportional frequencies (1–4 Hz) and amplitudes (15–4 mm), such that the overall rate of work performed on the body remained approximately constant (0.30  0.06 W\/kg), but the forces varied considerably. We used parameter iden- tiﬁcation to estimate series elasticity of the triceps surae tendon, as well as the work performed actively by muscle and passively by tendon. Net metabolic energy expenditure for bouncing at 1 Hz was 1.15  0.31 W\/kg, attributable mainly to active muscle work with an efﬁciency of 24  3%. But at 3 Hz (near resonance), most of the work was performed passively, so that active muscle work could account for only 40% of the net metabolic rate of 0.76  0.28 W\/kg. Near resonance, a cost for cyclical force that increased with both amplitude and frequency of force accounted for at least as much of the total energy expenditure as a cost for work. Series elasticity reduces the need for active work, but energy must still be expended for force production.  elastic energy; movement efﬁciency; resonant frequency","id":"69e33309-38e1-4f86-acc7-fd4c40647413"}

The tightness between artiﬁcial meniscus and articular head and the thickness of artiﬁcial meniscus will directly affect the matching between knee joint and human body. At present, the installation and adjustment of knee joint during operation largely depends on the personal experience of doctors. In this work, a ﬂexible pressure sensing device with bendable and distortable sensor arrays for force detec- tion in knee arthroplasty is fabricated and characterized to provide quantitative data guidance and reference for knee arthroplasty. The internal pressure of prosthesis knee joint can be effectively detected through real-time obtaining for output voltages of sensor array. The densely distributed measuring points feedback abundant pressure distribution information. The pressure device shows good repeatability, consistency and small hysteresis in large detection range and stability in dynamic response which indicates promising potential in applications of knee arthroplasty.

Agrawal2*  Abstract  Background: Damage to the cerebellum can affect neural structures involved in locomotion, causing gait and balance disorders. However, the integrity of cerebellum does not seem to be critical in managing sudden and unexpected environmental changes such as disturbances during walking. The cerebellum also plays a functional role in motor learning. Only a few effective therapies exist for individuals with cerebellar ataxia. With these in mind, we aimed at investigating: (1) corrective response of participants with cerebellar ataxia (CA) to unexpected gait perturbations; and (2) the effectiveness of a perturbation-based training to improve their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady walking. Specifically, we hypothesized that: (1) CA group can show a corrective behavior similar to that of a healthy control group; (2) the exposure to a perturbation-based treatment can exploit residual learning capability, thus improving their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady locomotion.  Methods: Ten participants with cerebellar ataxia and eight age-matched healthy adults were exposed to a single perturbation-based training session. The Active Tethered Pelvic Assist Device applied unexpected waist-pull perturbations while participants walked on a treadmill. Spatio-temporal parameters and dynamic stability were determined during corrective responses and steady locomotion, before and after the training.

Results: Data analysis revealed that individuals with cerebellar ataxia behaved differently from healthy volunteers: (1) they retained a wider base of support during corrective responses and steady gait both before and after the training; (2) due to the training, patients improved their anterior-posterior margin of stability during steady walking only.","id":"dcdb368b-a1ba-483a-9463-3a0f21c6ec74"}

Atkeson2  Abstract—Learning controllers for bipedal robots is a chal- lenging problem, often requiring expert knowledge and exten- sive tuning of parameters that vary in different situations. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has shown promise at automatically learning controllers for complex systems in simulation. This has been followed by a push towards learning controllers that can be transferred between simulation and hardware, primarily with the use of domain randomization. However, domain randomization can make the problem of ﬁnding stable controllers even more challenging, especially for underactuated bipedal robots. In this work, we explore whether policies learned in simulation can be transferred to hardware with the use of high-ﬁdelity simulators and structured controllers. We learn a neural network policy which is a part of a more structured controller. While the neural network is learned in simulation, the rest of the controller stays ﬁxed, and can be tuned by the expert as needed. We show that using this approach can greatly speed up the rate of learning in simulation, as well as enable transfer of policies between simulation and hardware. We present our results on an ATRIAS robot and explore the effect of action spaces and cost functions on the rate of transfer between simulation and hardware. Our results show that structured policies can indeed be learned in simulation and implemented on hardware successfully. This has several advantages, as the structure preserves the intuitive nature of the policy, and the neural network improves the performance of the hand-designed policy. In this way, we propose a way of using neural networks to improve expert designed controllers, while maintaining ease of understanding.

Quintero 外骨骼机器人 表面电刺激 步态恢复","content":"Abstract—This paper proposes a new configuration for a hybrid-FES gait restoration system, and presents a combination of simulation and experiment that support the feasibility of the proposed approach. Gait simulation results are presented that indicate the majority of load bearing and the majority of power for gait is provided by the legs (i.e., quadriceps muscle stimulation). Based on these simulations, experiments on healthy subjects indicate that the gait restoration approach should be capable of providing long periods of locomotion unimpeded by quadriceps muscle fatigue. I. INTRODUCTION REVIOUS studies have demonstrated that functional electrical stimulation (FES) can be used for restoring gait to people with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Standing and walking can provide significant physiological and psychological benefits to those with SCI [1-9]. However, electrically stimulated muscles suffer from rapid fatigue [10], relatively poor controllability of stimulated muscles, and the inability to control degrees-of-freedom outside the sagittal plane. Hybrid systems, which combine FES with an orthosis, can address several of the shortcomings of FES-aided gait. Use of an orthosis reduces the duty cycle of muscle stimulation during stance, reduce the complexity of gait by imposing kinematic constraints, and enables closed-loop control of electrically stimulated muscle by providing a mounting platform for joint angle sensors. Recent research in hybrid FES gait restoration systems using surface and implanted electrodes include [11-15] and [16-18], respectively. This paper assesses the feasibility of a hybrid FES system that is different from others previously reported ([11-18]). The approach uses modulated brakes at the hip and knee joints (like [11-15]), unidirectional joint coupling between knee and hip flexion, and a biasing spring that biases the knee joint, and via coupling the hip joint, toward a flexed position. The device is called the Joint Couple Orthosis (JCO). Due to the joint coupling and biasing, a swing-through gait can be generated utilizing only surface stimulation of the quadriceps group of each leg (i.e., one stimulation channel per leg). The orthosis is an energetically passive device because all the power for gait comes from the user’s metabolic power supply, which enhances the physiological benefit for the user and also minimizes the battery requirements for the orthosis.

It is designed to capture and store 20% of the biomechanical energy dissipated at the biological knee joint during decent phase and return the harnessed energy in the ascent phase in a squatting cycle.

A biomechanical comparison of back and front squats in healthy trained individuals. J Strength Cond Res 23(1): 284–292, 2008—The strength and stability of the knee plays an integral role in athletics and activities of daily living. A better under- standing of knee joint biomechanics while performing variations in rehabilitation and exercise of the squat would be useful prescription. We quantiﬁed and compared tibiofemoral joint kinetics as well as muscle activity while executing front and back squats. Because of the inherent change in the position of the center of mass of the bar between the front and back squat lifts, we hypothesized that the back squat would result in increased loads on the knee joint and that the front squat would result in increased knee extensor and decreased back extensor muscle activity. A crossover study design was used. To assess the net force and torque placed on the knee and muscle activation levels, a combination of video and force data, as well as surface electromyographic data, were collected from 15 healthy trained individuals. The back squat resulted in signiﬁcantly higher compressive forces and knee extensor moments than the front squat. Shear forces at the knee were in magnitude, posteriorly directed, and did not vary small between the squat variations. Although bar position did not inﬂuence muscle activity, muscle activation during the ascending phase was signiﬁcantly greater than during the descending phase. The front squat was as effective as the back squat in terms of overall muscle recruitment, with signiﬁcantly less com- pressive forces and extensor moments. The results suggest that front squats may be advantageous compared with back squats for individuals with knee problems such as meniscus tears, and for long-term joint health.

However, no studies have investigated how quickly individuals with neuromuscular disabilities adapt to assistance across different time scales, which makes experimental design challenging. The goal of this case series was to evaluate how individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) adapt to untethered powered plantar-flexor assistance within and across exoskeleton practice sessions. To assess inter-visit adaptation, one participant with mild CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level (GMFCS) I) completed 112 minutes of exoskeleton walking practice across four visits. This participant’s preferred level of assistance increased across practice sessions, and metabolic assessment indicated reduced acclimation time and improved walking economy; across visits, metabolic cost decreased by 18% during walking with exoskeleton assistance and by 13% while wearing the exoskeleton in an unassisted condition. To assess intra-visit adaptation, another participant with mild CP (GMFCS I) completed three 8-10 minute exoskeleton-assisted walking trials with the same level of assistance on a single visit. This participant exhibited a 16% reduction in the average metabolic cost relative to baseline during the final minute of walking on the third trial. Despite walking with assistance for 30 minutes, the participant did not appear to reach a fully acclimated state at the end of the third trial, suggesting that further improvements may have been observed with additional practice. These preliminary findings may prove useful for designing novel intervention studies and experimental protocols testing the potential benefit of wearable assistance in clinical populations. I. INTRODUCTION Neuromuscular deficits, including those caused by stroke, spinal cord injury, and cerebral palsy (CP), often result in impaired walking ability [1], [2]. Abnormal gait patterns caused by these conditions increase the energy required to walk and are associated with reduced levels of physical activity [3]–[5]. Techniques to improve walking efficiency have the potential to drastically improve the quality of life in these patient populations, particularly for CP, which is a child-onset condition with symptoms that typically worsen with age.

One is the rotor and air gap, and the other is the stator. The rotor and gap are uniform in their construction, and one can solve Maxwell’s Equations to derive an essentially exact analysis of their magnetic behaviors. The stator is much more intricate with teeth, slots, and wedges that stick into the slots from the teeth at the air gap. The stator also tends to saturate, whereas the rotor does not. It is not feasible to analyze the stator by analytically solving Maxwell’s Equations due to both geometric complexity and nonlinearity.  Fig. 1. Explanation of Approach.  One approach to analyzing the machine is Finite Element Analysis (FEA) which carries the expense of computation time. It requires a ﬁne mesh at least in the stator to capture its ge- ometrical intricacies. FEA is inappropriate for the rotor since the rotor can be effectively analyzed by an explicit solution of Maxell’s Equations. One could also analyze the stator using a nonlinear ﬂux tube analysis. This is an approximation, but not a bad one if attention is paid to geometric details.  Our approach is to analytically solve Maxwell’s Equations for each space harmonic in the rotor and airgap and to use a ﬂux tube analysis for the stator. Each analysis is appropriate for its own region, and quite fast compared to FEA.

Through theoretical analysis with our simpliﬁed system model, we found that the optimal passive stiffness matches the slope of the desired torque-angle relationship. We also conjectured that a bandwidth limit resulted in a maximum rate of change in torque error that can be commanded through control input, which is ﬁxed across desired and passive stiffness conditions. This led to hypotheses about the interactions among optimal control gains, passive stiffness and desired quasi- stiffness. Walking experiments were conducted with multiple angle-based desired torque curves. The observed lowest torque tracking errors identiﬁed for each combination of desired and passive stiffnesses were shown to be linearly proportional to the magnitude of the difference between the two stiffnesses. The proportional gains corresponding to the lowest observed errors were seen inversely proportional to passive stiffness values and to desired stiffness. These ﬁndings supported our hypotheses, and provide guidance to application-speciﬁc hardware customization as well as controller design for torque-controlled robotic legged locomotion.","id":"2157db61-aa36-4656-875c-8bd68f884056"}

Abstract—Lower limb prosthesis can beneﬁt from embedded systems capable of applying computer vision techniques to en- hance autonomous control and context awareness for intelligent decision making. In order to ﬁll in the gap of current literature of autonomous systems for prosthetic legs employing computer vision methods, we evaluate the performance capabilities of two off-the-shelf platforms, the Jetson TX2 and Raspberry Pi 3, by assessing their CPU load, memory usage, run time and classiﬁcation accuracy for different image sizes and widespread computer vision algorithms. We make use of a dataset that we collected for terrain recognition using images from a camera mounted on a leg, which would enable context-awareness for lower limb prosthesis. We show that, given reasonably large images and an appropriate frame selection method, it is possible to identify the terrain that a subject is going to step on, with the possibility of reconstructing the surface and obtaining its inclination. This is part of a proposed system equipped with an embedded camera and inertial measurement unit to recognize different types of terrain and estimate the slope of the surface in front of the subject.  I. INTRODUCTION  The relevance of providing a better quality of life to people with limb loss has only increased over time. The prospective amputee population growth is estimated to reach about 3.6 million by 2050 in the United States alone [1]. In order to improve amputee’s quality of life, diverse types of prostheses have been employed; however, there is no prosthetic solution to date that completely addresses the lack of comfort, reliability, and safety to the user, which are claimed by several amputees as the main reasons not to wear them [2]. One of the main challenges is to provide devices that are able to be natural extensions of the human body, which is an open research topic that branches across several areas: orthopedics, cardiology, neurology and many areas of engineering.","id":"cf82acd0-bef8-458d-8a50-fd77644941f3"}

All nodes of network can connect directly with the output. The ridge regression theory is used to calculate output weight of BLS. The outstanding advantage of BLS is that it can ﬁnd the globaloptimalsolution.Moreover,regularizationmethods,whichmake the results close to the true value, can effectively inhibit the distortion. In addition, it can increase feature nodes and enhancement nodes dynamically depending upon the residual error of network without retraining network.","id":"2dc97d0f-5902-4bc7-b903-f14d69907791"}

Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Various backdrivable lower-limb exoskeletons have demonstrated the electromechanical capability to assist volitional motions of able-bodied users and people with mild to moderate gait disorders, but there does not exist a control framework that can be deployed on any joint(s) to assist any activity of daily life in a provably stable manner. This paper presents the modular, multi-task optimal energy shaping (M-TOES) frame- work, which uses a convex, data-driven optimization to train an analytical control model to instantaneously estimate assistive joint torques across activities for any lower-limb exoskeleton joint configuration. The presented modular energy basis is sufficiently descriptive to fit normative human joint torques (given norma- tive feedback from signals available to a given joint configu- ration) across sit-stand transitions, stair ascent\/descent, ramp ascent\/descent, and level walking at different speeds. We evalu- ated controllers for four joint configurations (unilateral\/bilateral, hip\/knee) of the modular M-BLUE exoskeleton on eight able- bodied users navigating a multi-activity course comprising the primary activities of daily life. The two unilateral conditions significantly lowered overall muscle activation across all tasks and subjects (p < 0.001). In contrast, bilateral configurations had a minimal impact, possibly attributable to device weight and physical constraints.  Index Terms—Robotics, optimization, passivity-based control.  I.

Working in awkward kneeling postures for prolonged time periods can lead to knee pain, injuries, and osteoarthritis. In this ar- ticle, we present lightweight, wearable sensing, and knee assistive devices for construction workers during kneel- ing and squatting tasks. Analysis of kneeling on level and sloped surfaces (0◦, 10◦, and 20◦) is performed for single- and double-leg kneeling tasks.

Martin and Robert D. Gregg  Abstract—Predictive simulations of human walking could be used to in- vestigate a wide range of questions. Promising moderately complex models have been developed using the robotics control technique called hybrid zero dynamics (HZD). Existing simulations of human walking only con- sider the mean motion; therefore, they cannot be used to investigate fall risk, which is correlated with variability. This study determines how to in- corporate human-like variability into an HZD-based healthy human model to generate a more realistic gait. The key challenge is determining how to combine the existing mathematical description of variability with the dy- namic model so that the biped is still able to walk without falling. To do so, the commanded motion is augmented with a sinusoidal variability function and a polynomial correction function. The variability function captures the variationinjointangles,whilethecorrectionfunctionpreventsthevariabil- ity function from growing uncontrollably. The necessity of the correction function and the improvements with a reduction of stance ankle variability are demonstrated via simulations. The variability in temporal measures is shown to be similar to experimental values.  Index Terms—Biomimetics, human locomotion, legged robots, motion  control, variability.  I. INTRODUCTION  T HE ability to model and predict human gait can be used  to answer scientiﬁc questions that are difﬁcult or impos- sible to answer with human subject studies. For example, in- vestigations of periodic gait have provided insights into muscle contributions [1]. Further, predictive simulations could allow for preliminary testing of assistive devices, such as validating controllers for a powered leg prosthesis prior to hardware im- plementation with human amputee subjects [2].  Despite the common assumption that human gait is periodic, signiﬁcant variability exists. This variability has long-range cor- relationsbetweensteps[3],[4]andstructureatthejointlevel[5]. The joint-level variability has been mathematically described, but no attempt to incorporate it into a dynamic model has been made [5]. Increased variability is correlated with increased fall risk [3] but, somewhat surprisingly, variability and dynamic sta- bility are not equivalent [6].","id":"c461aebd-3f23-490a-8170-006da87ea5cd"}

Walsh, Member, IEEE  Abstract In this paper, we present the design and characterization of the ExoBoot, a soft inflatable robotic boot for assisting ankle plantarflexion during walking. The ExoBoot integrates a soft textile-based actuator and an IMU sensor into a textile boot, making it low-profile and lightweight. The inflatable actuator generates assistive plantarflexion torque when pressurized by bending on top of the boot. We characterize the torque generated by the ExoBoot at various pressures and ankle angles, achieving a maximum torque of 39 Nm at 483 kPa (70 psi) and 60 degrees ankle angle. In order to evaluate the performance of the ExoBoot during walking, a pilot study with one healthy subject was conducted. Actuation is triggered by an open loop pressure controller, based on the ankle angular velocity measured by an IMU, using high flow rate solenoid valves. At the peak of active assistance, pressure in the actuator reaches 75% of the supply pressure, and maximum torque applied on the ankle is estimated to be 23 Nm. These results demonstrate potential for the ExoBoot to reduce the metabolic cost of walking.  I. INTRODUCTION  textiles anchored to the limbs. Cable transmission allows the heavier components to be worn on a more proximal body location such as the waist so that added inertia to the body can be minimized. However, this approach, when combined with interfacing to the body via functional apparel anchors, presents technical challenges in delivering comfortable and controlled assistance to the wearer.  Another approach explored by some groups for the development of lightweight wearable robots is the use of pneumatic or fluid-powered systems. This approach also enables power to be transmitted remotely so that components on the limb can be lightweight. One of the most common types of pneumatic actuator used in wearable robots is the McKibben actuator, which contracts when inflated and display force-length properties similar to those of skeletal muscles [11], [13], [14]. McKibben actuators are both compliant and able to generate large force, but a major caveat comes from their limited stroke length. Thus, when attached across a joint, these actuators can place constraints on the  motion.","id":"4471fdf0-830a-4c6a-9c64-cdd03453bbc1"}

The motions are generated by a series of gait states with transitions at specific intervals. The joint trajectories are planned in joint space by interpolating the joint angles of assigned gait states with the dimensions of stairs and wearer. In order to generate the adaptive motion for various dimensions of stairs, multiple sensors and motion adaption strategy with sensing information and fuzzy logic inference are developed to ensure enough foot contact area and to avoid foot-stair collisions. Simulations and experiments of the generated joint trajectories and motion adaptation strategy are conducted on a lower limb exoskeleton. Results show that the proposed joint trajectories provide smooth assistance and the generated motion successfully adapts to various size of stairs. Keywords—exoskeleton; paraplegics; adaptive motion planning; stair ascent and descent. I. INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, exoskeletons have been developed for various applications [1] including human strength augmentation, motion rehabilitation and locomotion assistance for paraplegics. Until now, significant progress has been made in lower limb exoskeletons (LLEs) aiming at assisting locomotion for paraplegics, including ReWalk, Ekso, HAL [2], Vanderbilt exoskeleton [3], Mina [4], and WPAL [5]. Despite the promising progress and results of LLEs for level ground walking, few researchers discussed the strategies of motion assistance for ascending and descending stairs. Development of effective assistance strategies for ascending and descending stairs is an important step towards practical application of exoskeletons in daily life. Since paraplegic patients have lost most of the motor functions in their lower limbs, the control strategy of LLEs for these target users is mainly trajectory tracking [8] without considering effort and participation from the patients. Hence, generating joint trajectories of LLEs for the desired motions is an essential task. The common method of generating joint trajectories for walking assistance with LLE is to collect joint trajectories of healthy individuals. Then the recorded joint trajectories are replayed on LLEs for fixed walking pattern [3] [4]","id":"8b8077ca-16cd-437b-9447-dfd3cfce7628"}

Benchtop tests establish that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (∼1-3 Nm) and conﬁrm the small reﬂected inertia. Impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufﬁciently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback or lengthy tuning trials. Walking experiments validate performance under the designed loading conditions with minimal tuning. Lastly, the regenerative abilities, low friction, and small reﬂected inertia of the presented actuators reduced power con- sumption and acoustic noise compared to state-of-art powered legs.

INTRODUCTION  Use of conventional passive prostheses after lower-limb loss results in gait that is slower, less stable, and less energy efﬁ- cient than able-bodied locomotion [1], [2]. Passive prostheses aim to alleviate the effects of amputation using mechanisms such as springs, cams, and dampers to mimic normative gait patterns. However, passive prostheses are limited in function- ality due to the fact that such mechanisms can only dissipate energy that the user introduces. Although these passive devices restore some functionality, amputees are typically left with an asymmetric gait [3]. Moreover, most devices are designed for level-ground walking conditions and do not adequately","id":"d6e972e1-ad4f-48dc-811b-8016fbed8412"}

Powell, Aaron J. Young, Member, IEEE, and Gregory S. Sawicki, Member, IEEE  Abstract—Objective: Semi-active combining lightweight, low powered actuators and passive-elastic elements are a promising approach to portable robotic assistance during locomotion. Here, we introduce a novel semi-active hip exoskeleton concept and evaluate human walking performance across a range of parameters using a tethered robotic testbed. Methods: We emulated semi-active hip exoskeleton (exo) assistance by applying a virtual torsional spring with a fixed rotational stiffness and an equilibrium angle established in terminal swing phase (i.e., via pre- tension into stance). We performed a 2-D sweep of spring stiffness x equilibrium position parameters (30 combinations) across walking speed (1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m\/s) and measured metabolic rate to identify device parameters for optimal metabolic benefit. Results: At each speed, optimal exoskeleton spring settings provided a ~10% metabolic benefit compared to zero-impedance (ZI). Higher walking speeds required higher exoskeleton stiffness and lower equilibrium angle for maximal metabolic benefit. Optimal parameters tuned to each individual (user-dependent) provided significantly larger metabolic benefit than the average- best settings (user-independent) at all speeds except the fastest (p = 0.021, p = 0.001, and p = 0.098 at 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m\/s, respectively). We found significant correlation between changes in user’s muscle activity and changes in metabolic rate due to exoskeleton assistance, especially for muscles crossing the hip joint. Conclusion: A semi-active hip exoskeleton with spring- parameters personalized to each user could provide metabolic benefit across functional walking speeds. Minimizing muscle activity local to the exoskeleton is a promising approach for tuning assistance on-line on a user-dependent basis.  exoskeletons  Index Terms—Exoskeleton, Hip, Muscle Electromyography, Impedance Control, Metabolic Cost, Walking Speed  I.

Lee, Luke M. Mooney, StudentMember,IEEE, and Elliott J. Rouse, Member,IEEE  Abstract—The majority of commercially available pas- sive prosthetic feet are not capable of providing joint mechanics that match that of the intact human ankle. Due to their cantilever design, their stiffness characteristics contrast with what has been observed in the biological ankle, namely, an increase in stiffness during the stance phase of walking. In this paper, we introduce the design and control of a pneumatic foot-ankle prosthesis that attempts to provide biomimetic mechanics. The prosthesis is com- prised of a pneumatic cylinder in series with a ﬁberglass leaf spring, and a solenoid valve to control the ﬂow of air between the two sides of the cylinder. The solenoid valve acts as a mechanical clutch, enabling resetting of the ankle’s equilibrium position. By adjusting the pressure inside the cylinder, the prosthesis can be customized to provide a range of ankle mechanics. A mechanical testing machine is used to compare the torque-angle curve of the pneumatic prosthesis with a low-proﬁle passive prosthetic foot. Finally, data are presented of one transtibial amputee walking with the prosthesis at 1.2 m\/s. The testing shows that the pneumatic prosthesis is capable of providing an appropriate range of motion as well a maximum torque of 94 Nm, while returning approximately 11.5 J of energy.","id":"df17feb7-3b0c-4352-8630-1836b12bdd94"}

Rouse, Member, IEEE, Levi J. Hargrove, Member, IEEE, Eric J. Perreault, Member, IEEE, and Todd A. Kuiken, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Human joint impedance is the dynamic relationship between the differential change in the position of a perturbed joint and the corresponding response torque; it is a fundamental property that governs how humans interact with their environ- ments. It is critical to characterize ankle impedance during the stance phase of walking to elucidate how ankle impedance is reg- ulated during locomotion, as well as provide the foundation for future development of natural, biomimetic powered prostheses and their control systems. In this study, ankle impedance was estimated using a model consisting of stiffness, damping and in- ertia. Ankle torque was well described by the model, accounting % of the variance. When averaged across subjects, for the stiffness component of impedance was found to increase linearly from 1.5 to 6.5 Nm\/rad\/kg between 20% and 70% of stance phase. The damping component was found to be statisti- cally greater than zero only for the estimate at 70% of stance phase, with a value of 0.03 Nms\/rad\/kg. The slope of the ankle’s torque-angle curve—known as the quasi-stiffness—was not sta- tistically different from the ankle stiffness values, and showed remarkable similarity. Finally, using the estimated impedance, the speciﬁcations for a biomimetic powered ankle prosthesis were introduced that would accurately emulate human ankle impedance during locomotion.  I.

Kang4, Vito Monaco1, Silvestro Micera1,5 and Sunil K. Agrawal2*  Abstract  Background: Damage to the cerebellum can affect neural structures involved in locomotion, causing gait and balance disorders. However, the integrity of cerebellum does not seem to be critical in managing sudden and unexpected environmental changes such as disturbances during walking. The cerebellum also plays a functional role in motor learning. Only a few effective therapies exist for individuals with cerebellar ataxia. With these in mind, we aimed at investigating: (1) corrective response of participants with cerebellar ataxia (CA) to unexpected gait perturbations; and (2) the effectiveness of a perturbation-based training to improve their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady walking. Specifically, we hypothesized that: (1) CA group can show a corrective behavior similar to that of a healthy control group; (2) the exposure to a perturbation-based treatment can exploit residual learning capability, thus improving their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady locomotion.  Methods: Ten participants with cerebellar ataxia and eight age-matched healthy adults were exposed to a single perturbation-based training session. The Active Tethered Pelvic Assist Device applied unexpected waist-pull perturbations while participants walked on a treadmill. Spatio-temporal parameters and dynamic stability were determined during corrective responses and steady locomotion, before and after the training. The ANalysis Of VAriance was the main statistical test used to assess the effects of group (healthy vs CA) and training (baseline vs post) on spatio-temporal parameters of the gait and margin of stability.  Results: Data analysis revealed that individuals with cerebellar ataxia behaved differently from healthy volunteers: (1) they retained a wider base of support during corrective responses and steady gait both before and after the training; (2) due to the training, patients improved their anterior-posterior margin of stability during steady walking only.","id":"dcdb368b-a1ba-483a-9463-3a0f21c6ec74"}

Bennett, StudentMember,IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb, Member,IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes a control method intended to facilitate improved control of a myoelectric prosthesis containing a wrist rotator. Rather than exclu- sively utilizing electromyogram (EMG) for the control of all myoelectric components (e.g., a hand and a wrist), the proposed controller utilizes inertial measurement (from six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU)) to sense upper arm abduction\/adduction, and uses this input to command a wrist rotation velocity. As such, the controller essen- tially substitutes shoulder abduction\/adduction in place of agonist\/antagonist EMG to control wrist angular velocity, which preserves EMG for control of the hand (or other arm components). As a preliminary assessment of efﬁcacy, the control method was implemented on a transradial prosthe- sis prototype with a powered wrist rotator and hand, and experimentally assessed on ﬁve able-bodied subjects who wore the prototype using an able-bodied adaptor and one transradial amputee subject while performing assessments representative of activities of daily living. The assessments compared the (timed) performance of the combined EMG\/ IMU-based control method with a (conventional) sequential EMG control approach. Results of the assessment indicate that the able-bodiedsubjectswere able to perform the tasks 33% faster on average with the EMG\/IMU-based method, relativetoaconventionalsequentialEMGmethod.Thesame assessment was subsequently conducted using a single transradial amputee subject, which resulted in similar per- formance trends, although with a somewhat lessened effect size—speciﬁcally,the amputee subject was on average 22% faster in performing tasks with the IMU-based controller.","id":"964cfacc-746b-4053-9086-c892a47f4c8d"}

ACCEPTED JANUARY 2022 1 Abstract—Ankle exoskeletons have the potential to improve mobility, but common controllers are often inflexible to variations in tasks, such as changes in walking speed. To enable effective variable-speed exoboot control, we developed and validated a two-headed convolutional neural network trained to (1) classify stance versus swing and (2) predict the phase during stance, which was then mapped to a desired exoboot torque. This Machine Learning Estimator (MLE) was trained from nine participants walking at three speeds and four exoboot assistance levels. A Time-Based Estimator (TBE) that predicted gait phase from the two previous stride durations was used to apply realistic torques during MLE training and served as a within–participant control condition. The MLE was validated online with three new participants walking at a range of speeds and torques, both interpolating within and extrapolating outside the training set. Online validation accuracy (RMSE) across tested speeds and torque levels was 3.9%. On a simple walking task in which treadmill speed was varied sinusoidally between 1.1 and 1.6 m\/s with a 30 s period, the three participants exhibited a mean 5.2% decrease in metabolic expenditure with the MLE compared to no-exo (boots only), but exhibited a 5.4% increase when walking with the TBE. The MLE more accurately predicted heel strike and toe off events (heel strike Mean Absolute Error: 9.6 ms; toe off MAE: 13.2 ms) than the TBE (heel strike MAE: 19.1 ms; toe off MAE: 34 ms).

This high metabolic cost may be explained by the inability of available passive prostheses to replicate the biomechanics of intact legs during walking. Powered prostheses promise to address this issue by imitating the power generation of intact legs. Several studies have investigated the effect of power generation and energy injection at the ankle joint in transtibial amputees. In contrast, no study has directly addressed knee power generation in transfemoral amputees. This study investigates the effect of knee power generation in late stance in one transfemoral amputee subject using a lightweight powered prosthesis. Experimental results suggest that injecting positive energy into the gait cycle at the knee level may improve gait ability by reducing effort. I. INTRODUCTION Lower-limb amputation affects mobility and causes secondary health effects such as back pain and osteoarthritis [1]. Experimental studies show that amputees expend significantly more energy than able-bodied individuals to ambulate due to the compensatory movements that are required, for example, to accelerate their center of mass forward [2]. These issues can largely be attributed to the limitations of most prosthesis technologies, which rely on passive components such as mechanical springs and dampers, therefore are unable to actively generate power and inject energy into the gait cycle as intact legs would [3]. These limitations are being addressed by using battery-operated servomotors that can actively regulate joint torque and energy to more closely imitate the biomechanics of intact legs. Able-bodied studies suggest that positive power is a crucial part of the gait cycle [3]. Positive power provides energy to accelerate the body’s center of mass forward at the end of stance as well as to accelerate the leg into swing, thus providing clearance and preparing the leg for the next step. Focusing on the knee joint, both positive and negative power phases occur in stance phase [4]. When the body weight is accepted after heel-strike, power is absorbed by the knee flexion. This negative energy is then returned to positive energy as the knee transitions to extension in mid-stance. In late stance, the knee generates positive power to initiate knee flexion and accelerate the leg into swing.

INTRODUCTION Many people wish to perform at a high level while playing an active role in sports. Interest in enabling the disabled and the elderly to participate in sports has increased in recent years. Universal sports and superhuman sports that enable everyone to play in the same competition regardless of the presence or absence of a disability, age difference, or gender has also attracted increased attention. However, to be active in sports, it is necessary for players to condition their physical capability and technique with daily training. Active motion assist devices are currently being actively developed. These devices are of two types: active type [1-3], which is equipped with actuators; and passive type [4-6], which uses spring elements. In the active type, it is necessary to mount an energy source (for example, a battery, a compressed gas tank, or a compressor) that drives the actuator while achieving a strong assisting force by the actuator and performing fine control. This makes the overall system bulky and heavy, and also incurs high maintenance costs. The passive type is inexpensive and lightweight. However, the assist power generated by current passive assist devices is not sufficiently large to aid participants in sports. Further, the spring elements sometimes disrupt the wearer’s motion because they always generate force, and provide resistive force in certain cases","id":"c3c895c8-7ae1-4b34-a8e9-e9390627b1c2"}

Sawicki1,2,3*, Owen N. Beck1,2, Inseung Kang1 and Aaron J. Young1,3*  Abstract  Since the early 2000s, researchers have been trying to develop lower-limb exoskeletons that augment human mobility by reducing the metabolic cost of walking and running versus without a device. In 2013, researchers finally broke this ‘metabolic cost barrier’. We analyzed the literature through December 2019, and identified 23 studies that demonstrate exoskeleton designs that improved human walking and running economy beyond capable without a device. Here, we reviewed these studies and highlighted key innovations and techniques that enabled these devices to surpass the metabolic cost barrier and steadily improve user walking and running economy from 2013 to nearly 2020. These studies include, physiologically-informed targeting of lower-limb joints; use of off-board actuators to rapidly prototype exoskeleton controllers; mechatronic designs of both active and passive systems; and a renewed focus on human-exoskeleton interface design. Lastly, we highlight emerging trends that we anticipate will further augment wearable-device performance and pose the next grand challenges facing exoskeleton technology for augmenting human mobility.

These methods vary from the simplest case of using solely commanded motor torques, to partial consideration of the robot dynamics, to advanced methods considering full robot dynamics such as inverse dynamics (ID) and nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) based algorithms. Dynamic and friction models of the exoskeleton were developed and their parameters were identified using an evolutionary optimization algorithm to ensure high parameter accuracy. When used with accurate model parameters, ID method led to 20 to 22% average error, while NDO method generated 12 to 18% average error, as evaluated in experiments with a force sensor. These values compare to average error values of up to 132% for using motor torques only, and between 25 to 69% when partial dynamics were used. A sensitivity analysis of the ID and NDO methods to inaccuracies in model parameter estimations revealed considerable sensitivity of these advanced methods to model parameter variations. A summary is provided for the typical estimation accuracy levels that can be expected of these methods and discuss the limitations and considerations that should be taken into account for their use.

However, existing intelli- gent servo control strategies for robot joints have problems of computational redundancy, limited prediction accuracy, and insufﬁcient generalization capability. To solve these problems, this article proposes a servo control strategy for robot joints that is based on the incremental Bayesian fuzzy broad learning system (IBFBLS). First, we construct an in- telligent servo control strategy with broad learning system on the basis of fuzzy rules to achieve good self-learning and generalization abilities. Second, the learning parameters of the control strategy are optimized by Bayesian inference to achieve precise joint servo control. Finally, the conver- gence of the control strategy is enhanced by combining it with Lyapunov theory to constrain the learning param- eters of the proposed control strategy. The feasibility and superiority of the proposed control strategy are veriﬁed by simulation to compare it with existing intelligent servo con- trol methods. In addition, experiments are conducted using robot joint test bed. Both the simulation and experiments verify that the proposed servo control strategy outperforms other servo control methods with respect to tracking ac- curacy, stability, and convergence. The root-mean-square error in servo control of robot joints was 0.012%, which has been reduced by 55.56% compared with the current state of the art.

The primary novel aspect of the controller is that it employs a virtual flow field to influence movement during swing, rather than a more typical potential-energy-based field. The controller was tested on a single stroke subject. The stroke subject’s leg kinematics demonstrate that the controller is capable of appropriately influencing leg kinematics during overground walking. I. INTRODUCTION ach year, about 665,000 people survive a stroke in the United States. Studies indicate that six months after the stroke, about 50% of these individuals had some form of lower extremity hemiparesis, and 30% were unable to walk without assistance [1], [2]. The resulting loss of mobility has detrimental effects on people’s physical and mental health and quality of life. Conventional post-stroke gait therapy includes overground gait training, in which one or more physical therapists (PTs) manually guides a patient’s movement while walking [3]. Lower limb exoskeletons may offer an assistive tool to PTs to aid in overground gait therapy. In this scenario, the exoskeleton can guide the patient’s legs through a desired motion, while a single PT can provide balance assistance (e.g., with a gait belt). In order to provide appropriate functionality in this regard, an exoskeleton should ideally offer movement guidance and assistance without interfering with a patient’s ability to correct for walking balance. Since two important factors in balance correction during walking are selection of step time and step length, an exoskeleton controller for these purposes should ideally allow patient-controlled variability in step length and step time [4], [5]. Some prior work has described controllers that influence walking motion, while allowing a patient to control step length or step time [6]–[10]. These controllers can loosely be grouped into two categories: 1) oscillator-based approaches [6], [7] and 2) potential-energy-based path approaches [8]–[10]. Both have been shown to be effective for overground exoskeleton-assisted walking. However, both have limitations. Specifically, since oscillator-based approaches do not employ a reference path, they are limited in their ability to influence inter-joint coordination during walking. Path-based approaches can influence inter-joint coordination, and are constructed of potential-energy-based fields","id":"800871d9-2552-4b96-9844-9da5491e2579"}

Read Full License  Page 1\/16  Abstract  Background: After above-knee amputation, the missing biological knee and ankle are replaced with passive prosthetic devices which are able to dissipate limited amounts of energy using resistive damper systems during “negative energy” tasks like sit-down. However, passive prosthetic knees are not able to provide high levels of resistance at the end of the sit-down movement when the knee is \u0000exed and users need the most support. Consequently, users are forced  to over-compensate with their upper body, residual hip, and intact leg, and\/or sit down with a ballistic and uncontrolled movement. Powered prostheses have the potential to solve this problem by controlling the joints using motors, which can produce higher levels of resistance at a larger range of joint positions than  passive damper systems. Therefore, powered prostheses have the potential to make sitting down more controlled and less di\u0000cult for above-knee amputees, improving their functional mobility.  Methods: Ten individuals with above-knee amputations sat down using their prescribed passive prosthesis and a research powered knee-ankle prosthesis. Subjects performed three sit-downs with each prosthesis while we recorded joint angles, forces, and muscle activity from the intact quadricep muscle. Our  main outcome measures were weight-bearing symmetry and muscle effort of the intact quadricep muscle. We performed paired t-tests on these outcome measures to test for signi\u0000cant differences between passive and powered prostheses.

Equinus is common in children with cerebral palsy; as such, children ages 5-12 are the intended users of the device. Equinus is a condition in which the patient’s ankle motion is restricted. As a result, gait becomes awkward and inefficient, and the propulsive force a typical human body would receive from ankle motion is significantly reduced or lost completely. Patients with equinus tend to develop detrimental gait patterns, most notably toe-walking. Improving their gait with an assistive device should help these patients manage their condition.  The goal of improving gait was accomplished by designing an exoskeleton device that provided an assistive propulsive force to the patient’s foot. To begin the design process, customer needs were outlined, based on requirements and specifications provided by the client, Dr. Zachary Lerner (the director of NAU’s Biomechatronics Lab). Engineering requirements were then developed to meet the customer needs. Primary requirements included the use of a Bowden cable system to provide propulsion, adjustability of the device for a range of equinus severity, a need for reduced weight, and a minimum torque applied at the foot.

I‑Chieh Lee1*  , Bretta L. Fylstra1, Ming Liu1, Tommaso Lenzi2 and He Huang1  Abstract Background: Energy cost minimization has been widely accepted to regulate gait. Optimization principles have been frequently used to explain how individuals adapt their gait pattern. However, there have been rare attempts to account for the role of variability in this optimization process. Motor redundancy can enable individuals to perform tasks reliably while achieving energy optimization. However, we do not know how the non‑goal‑equivalent and goal‑ equivalent variability is regulated. In this study, we investigated how unilateral transfemoral amputees regulate step and stride variability based on the task to achieve energy economy.  Methods: Nine individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputation walked on a treadmill at speeds of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 m\/s using their prescribed passive prostheses. We calculated the step‑to‑step and stride‑to‑stride variability and applied goal equivalent manifold (GEM) based control to decompose goal‑equivalent and non‑goal‑equivalent manifold. To quantify the energy economy, the energy recovery rate (R) was calculated based on potential energy and kinetic energy. Comparisons were made between GEM variabilities and commonly used standard deviation measure‑ ments. A linear regression model was used to investigate the trade‑off between R and GEM variabilities.  Results: Our analysis shows greater variability along the goal‑equivalent manifold compared to the non‑goal‑ equivalent manifold (p < 0.001). Moreover, our analysis shows lower energy recovery rate for amputee gait compared to nonamputee gait (at least 20% less at faster walking speed). We found a negative relationship between energy recovery rate and non‑goal‑equivalent variability. Compared to the standard deviation measurements, the variability decomposed using GEM reflected the preferred walking speed and the limitation of the passive prosthetic device.","id":"8d51c9d8-b604-47f5-a718-baca25209ba3"}

We demonstrate that the pressurized actuators can generate motion and force comparable to natural human ﬁngers through bench- top testing. We apply textile-elastomer capacitive sensors to the glove to track ﬁnger ﬂexion via strain and detect contact with objects via force. Intuitive user control is achieved via a state machine controller based on signals from the integrated sensors to detect relative changes in hand-object interactions. Results from an initial evaluation with 3 participants with spinal cord injury (SCI), of varied injury levels and years since injury, wearing and controlling the glove show an average of 87% improvement in grasping force, and improvements in functional assessments for participants with recent injuries. A signiﬁcant variation in response suggests further investigation is required to understand the adaptation needed across different injury levels and durations since injury. Additionally, we evaluate the controller and ﬁnd an average of 3 seconds from user initiations to completed grasps, and 10% inadvertent grasp triggers and no false releases when objects are held.  I. INTRODUCTION  Injury to the upper spinal cord can result in paralysis and impaired hand motor functions. Loss of hand motor functions is especially devastating as patients cannot independently perform activities of daily living (ADLs).

Such a side effect causes unnatural posture and additional effort for the wearer to maintain the body balance. To minimize the side effect, this paper proposes a control method of an exoskeletal robot to assist a certain target motion with body weight support and balance maintenance functions at the same time. The exoskeletal robot used in this study measures the center of pressure on the wearer’s feet in real-time using air pressure sensors embedded in the soles of the shoes. Then the proposed control method determines the direction of the assistive force to assist the wearers balancing. The desired assistance torque required for realizing the proposed assistance method is precisely generated by series elastic actuators installed at the hip and knee joints of the exoskeletal robot. In the experiments, an assistance effect is veriﬁed by measuring the EMG signals of the six lower-limb muscles that are mainly involved in the target movement. This paper also introduces the experimental results that show the proposed assistive method reduces the EMG signal in ﬁve muscles, and reduces the variation of the COP movement compared to the case where only the body weight support method is applied in the control of the exoskeletal robot.

Kuo  Abstract—Unilateral lower-limb amputees exhibit asymmetry in many gait features, such as ground force, step time, step length, and joint mechanics. Although these asymmetries result from weak prosthetic-side push-off, there is no proven mechanistic explanation of how that impairment propagates to the rest of the body. We used a simple dynamic walking model to explore possible consequences of a unilateral impairment similar to that of a transtibial amputee. The model compensates for reduced push-off work from one leg by performing more work elsewhere, for example during the middle of stance by either or both legs. The model predicts several gait abnormalities, including slower forward velocity of the body center-of-mass during intact-side stance, greater energy dissipation in the intact side, and more positive work overall. We tested these predictions with data from unilateral transtibial amputees (N = 11) and nonamputee control subjects (N = 10) walking on an instrumented treadmill. We ob- served several predicted asymmetries, including forward velocity during stance phases and energy dissipation from the two limbs, as well as greater work overall. Secondary adaptations, such as to reduce discomfort, may exacerbate asymmetry, but these simple principles suggest that some asymmetry may be unavoidable in cases of unilateral limb loss.

Nor is it clear what biomechanical compensations might be most economical for amputees [11]–[15]. A mechanistic study of the fundamental effects of unilateral limb loss and strategies for compensating for this loss might yield insights regarding asymmetric gait.","id":"ac58087e-881f-4a05-bcfb-732cb4ff14f5"}

Different computational processing models were developed for the user and the unit. A processing method was proposed in which inverse dynamics analysis is used to calculate the assist moment from user processing and the system weight compensation from unit processing. A floor reaction force for the system weight compensation processing method was established to allow system weight compensation control. A high degree of stability in the vector orientation of the floor reaction force for system weight compensation was shown in tests. In addition, this method enables estimation of the user’s floor reaction force vector by applying the user’s dynamics model. Thus, it was shown that there are good prospects for the realization of a user-friendly walking assist system that does not employ floor reaction force sensors in the system.  1. Introduction  It is predicted that the aging of Japanese society will continue to increase in pace in the future. The elderly tend to withdraw from participation in society when they begin to lose confidence in their health or physical strength(1). Taking this social background into consideration, Honda is seeking to contribute to supporting the lives of the elderly by conducting research on a wearable walking assist system that reduces the load on the body during movement. Prioritizing the comfort of the user, the goal of the research is to realize a “user-friendly walking assist system.” Research to date has focused on enabling the motion of the system to follow the user’s intentions, and has sketched an outline of a system using a proposed joint moment assist method that estimates joint moment as the user is moving and provides assist power depending on the estimated joint moment(2).  In an attempt to increase the user-friendliness of the system, the goal of the research discussed in this paper was to help prevent the user from having to support the  weight of the system, through the development of a new control method that enables the weight of the system to be compensated at the same time as assist is provided to the user.  2.

Collins∗  Abstract—Actuator power consumption is a limiting factor in mobile robot design. In this paper we introduce the concept of an energy-recycling actuator, which uses an array of springs and clutches to capture and return elastic energy in parallel with an electric motor. Engaging and disengaging clutches ap- propriately could reduce electrical energy consumption without sacriﬁcing controllability, but presents a challenging control problem. We formulated the optimal control objective of minimizing actuator power consumption as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) and solved for the global minimum. For a given actuator design and a wide range of simulated torque and rotation patterns, all corresponding to zero net work over one cycle, we compared optimized actuator energy consumption to that of an optimized gear motor with simple parallel elasticity. The simulated energy-recycling actuator con- sumed less electrical energy: 57% less on average and 80% less in the best case. These results demonstrate an effective approach to optimal control of this type of system, and suggest that energy-recycling actuators could substantially reduce power consumption in some robotics applications.

However, existing intelli- gent servo control strategies for robot joints have problems of computational redundancy, limited prediction accuracy, and insufﬁcient generalization capability. To solve these problems, this article proposes a servo control strategy for robot joints that is based on the incremental Bayesian fuzzy broad learning system (IBFBLS). First, we construct an in- telligent servo control strategy with broad learning system on the basis of fuzzy rules to achieve good self-learning and generalization abilities. Second, the learning parameters of the control strategy are optimized by Bayesian inference to achieve precise joint servo control. Finally, the conver- gence of the control strategy is enhanced by combining it with Lyapunov theory to constrain the learning param- eters of the proposed control strategy. The feasibility and superiority of the proposed control strategy are veriﬁed by simulation to compare it with existing intelligent servo con- trol methods. In addition, experiments are conducted using robot joint test bed. Both the simulation and experiments verify that the proposed servo control strategy outperforms other servo control methods with respect to tracking ac- curacy, stability, and convergence.

Accu- rate force\/torque sensing is necessary to measure the physical interaction between the user, the prosthesis, and the environment. Most available solutions consist of retroﬁtting an off-the-shelf load cell, which leads to suboptimal designs regarding weight and size, ultimately reducing the prosthesis usability. To address this limitation, we propose to instrument an existing prosthesis component, namely, a pyramid adapter, with force\/torque sensing and an inertial measurement unit. Magnetic sensing of large structural deformations is used to improve system reliability and reduce costs. Testing shows that the proposed sensor prototype can sense up to 120 Nm and 2500 N of torque and force and has 2.1% and 8.3% nonlinearity, respectively, during walking. The total weight is 150 g—only 66 g more than a standard pyramid adapter without force\/torque instrumentation. Amputee testing with robotic leg prosthesis is conducted to validate the instrumented pyramid in a case scenario.  the physical interaction between the user, the prosthesis, and the environment.  The development of force\/torque sensors for prosthetic applications requires satisfying competing design requirements in terms of a wide force and torque range and a small, lightweight package. During common ambulation activities, torque and force at the ankle, normalized by the user’s body weight, peak at about 1.7 Nm\/kg and 11.4 N\/kg [10], respectively. This relatively wide range of torque and force is easier to satisfy if the sensor dimensions and weight are not critical. However, in prosthetic applications, the size of the force\/torque sensor affects the overall prosthesis dimensions, especially the build height, which ultimately determines how many people can use the prosthesis [11]. Moreover, increasing the prosthesis weight affects gait negatively by increasing metabolic consumption and muscle effort [12], [13]. As a result, it is important to minimize build height and weight in sensors used for prosthetic applications.  Index Terms—Ambulation, force\/torque sensing, prosthetics.  I.

Sawicki∗ and Nabil S. Khan  Abstract—Goal: A recent experiment demonstrated that when humans wear unpowered elastic ankle exoskeletons with inter- mediate spring stiffness, they can reduce their metabolic energy cost to walk by ∼7%. Springs that are too compliant or too stiff have little beneﬁt. The purpose of this study was to use model- ing and simulation to explore the muscle-level mechanisms for the “sweet spot” in stiffness during exoskeleton assisted walking. Methods: We developed a simple lumped uniarticular muscu- loskeletal model of the plantarﬂexors operating in parallel with an elastic “exo-tendon.” Using an inverse approach with constrained kinematics and kinetics, we rapidly simulated human walking over a range of exoskeleton stiffness values and examined the underly- ing neuromechanics and energetics of the biological plantarﬂexors. Results: Stiffer ankle exoskeleton springs resulted in larger de- creases in plantarﬂexor muscle forces, activations, and metabolic energyconsumption.However,intheprocessofunloadingthecom- pliant biological muscle–tendon unit, the muscle fascicles expe- rienced larger excursions that negatively impacted series elastic element recoil that is characteristic of a tuned “catapult mecha- nism.” Conclusion: The combination of disrupted muscle–tendon dynamics and the need to produce compensatory forces\/moments to maintain overall net ankle moment invariance could explain the “sweet spot” in metabolic performance at intermediate ankle exoskeleton stiffness. Future work will aim to provide experimen- tal evidence to support the model predictions presented here us- ing ultrasound imaging of muscle-level dynamics during walking with elastic ankle exoskeletons.

Abstract—Neuromuscular impairment associated with cere- bral palsy (CP) often leads to life-long walking deﬁcits. Our goal was to evaluate the ability of a novel untethered wearable ankle exoskeleton to reduce the severity of gait pathology from CP. In this clinical feasibility study of ﬁve individuals with CP, we used instrumented gait analysis to quantify how powered plantar-ﬂexor assistance affected gait mechanics following multi-visit acclimation. Compared to how each participant walked normally, walking with unteth- ered exoskeleton assistance resulted in improved ankle plantar-ﬂexion and knee extension; residual ﬂexion deformity across the lower-extremity improved by a clinically signif- icant 14.4 (p = 0.022). Powered plantar-ﬂexor assistance increased average total positive ankle power by 44% (p = 0.037), and resulted in a 30% reduction in average negative biological ankle power (p = 0.004) and a 29% reduction in average positive hip power (p = 0.009). These ﬁndings suggest that powered ankle assistance augmented, rather than simply replaced, biological function to produce a more efﬁcient gait pattern, which was corroborated by a 19% improvement in metabolic cost of transport (p = 0.011).

Bolus, Student Member, IEEE, Hyeon Ki Jeong, Bradley M. Blaho, Mohsen Safaei, Aaron J. Young, Omer T. Inan, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract— Objective: Tendons are essential components of the musculoskeletal system and, as with any mechanical structure, can fail under load. Tendon injuries are common and can be debilitating, and research suggests that a better understanding of their loading conditions could help mitigate injury risk and improve rehabilitation. To that end, we present a novel method of noninvasively assessing parameters related to mechanical load in the Achilles tendon using burst vibrations. Methods: These vibrations, produced by a small vibration motor on the skin superficial to the tendon, are sensed by a skin-mounted accelerometer, which measures the tendon’s response to burst excitation under varying tensile load. In this study, twelve healthy subjects performed a variety of everyday tasks designed to expose the Achilles tendon to a range of loading conditions. To approximate the vibration motor-tendon system and provide an explanation for observed changes in tendon response, a 2-degree- of-freedom mechanical systems model was developed. Results: Reliable, characteristic changes in the burst response profile as a function of Achilles tendon tension were observed during all loading tasks. Using a machine learning-based approach, we developed a regression model capable of accurately estimating net ankle moment—which captures general trends in tendon tension—across a range of walking speeds and across subjects (R2 = 0.85). Simulated results of the mechanical model accurately recreated behaviors observed in vivo. Finally, preliminary, proof- of-concept results from a fully wearable system demonstrated trends similar to those observed in experiments conducted using benchtop equipment. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an untethered, unobtrusive system can effectively assess tendon loading during activities of daily life. Significance: Access to such a system would have broad implications for injury recovery and prevention, athletic training, and the study of human movement.

Since the energy supplied by the proposed EMG is discontinuous in time, a tailored energy management circuit is necessary to adapt the harvested energy to the load energy requirements. The electromechanical generator is composed by two series of NdFeB magnets positioned into each condyle and a coil, placed in the pin of the tibial insert, which collects the magnetic flux variations, generated by the knee movements. A total knee replacement (TKR) prototype has been developed and realized in order to reproduce the knee mechanics. Therefore, electrical performances have been evaluated, at the first, measuring the EMG open circuit voltage by means of a high impedance buffer amplifier, and, subsequently, connecting the EMG to the energy management circuit able to manage the produced energy and to power an implanted circuit for force measurement inside the human knee. The tests showed that the EHS is able to supply the measuring circuit guaranteeing a tension between 2.45 V and 2.15 V for 25 ms almost every 1.5 s with a walking velocity of 1 Hz. The tests successfully demonstrate the possibility to power a measurement circuit transmitting the measurement data outside the prosthesis every about one-step and half.

It is mainly composed of a frame worn outside the human body and a power system. It is characterized by relying on the power system to help human limb joints and muscle movement, which is used to enhance, extend, compensate or replace human limb functions and capabilities [1], such as enhancing human performance, increasing endurance, and assisting the disabled and the elderly intheirmovements.Theapplicationsofthelowerlimbsaremore abundant than those of the upper limbs [2], because they are all related to the walking function of human beings: on the one hand,walkingbipedallyanduprightisamanifestationofhuman  beingsdistinguishingthemselvesfromotheranimals,andisalso a prerequisite for liberating human hands to create and use tools and prompting the brain to continuously evolve; on the other hand,humanbeingswanttobreakthroughthelimitsofthelower limbs, such as strength, speed, endurance and so on, in order to realize the needs of operations in their specialized ﬁelds [3].","id":"e54eee03-0a85-43c5-8772-c4f26696ad0a"}

The motions are generated by a series of gait states with transitions at specific intervals. The joint trajectories are planned in joint space by interpolating the joint angles of assigned gait states with the dimensions of stairs and wearer. In order to generate the adaptive motion for various dimensions of stairs, multiple sensors and motion adaption strategy with sensing information and fuzzy logic inference are developed to ensure enough foot contact area and to avoid foot-stair collisions. Simulations and experiments of the generated joint trajectories and motion adaptation strategy are conducted on a lower limb exoskeleton. Results show that the proposed joint trajectories provide smooth assistance and the generated motion successfully adapts to various size of stairs. Keywords—exoskeleton; paraplegics; adaptive motion planning; stair ascent and descent. I. INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, exoskeletons have been developed for various applications [1] including human strength augmentation, motion rehabilitation and locomotion assistance for paraplegics. Until now, significant progress has been made in lower limb exoskeletons (LLEs) aiming at assisting locomotion for paraplegics, including ReWalk, Ekso, HAL [2], Vanderbilt exoskeleton [3], Mina [4], and WPAL [5]. Despite the promising progress and results of LLEs for level ground walking, few researchers discussed the strategies of motion assistance for ascending and descending stairs. Development of effective assistance strategies for ascending and descending stairs is an important step towards practical application of exoskeletons in daily life. Since paraplegic patients have lost most of the motor functions in their lower limbs, the control strategy of LLEs for these target users is mainly trajectory tracking [8] without considering effort and participation from the patients. Hence, generating joint trajectories of LLEs for the desired motions is an essential task. The common method of generating joint trajectories for walking assistance with LLE is to collect joint trajectories of healthy individuals. Then the recorded joint trajectories are replayed on LLEs for fixed walking pattern [3] [4]","id":"8b8077ca-16cd-437b-9447-dfd3cfce7628"}

Conventionally, measurements of body motion are obtained by motion capture cameras, of which the bulkiness and high cost make it hard to capture some movements that need broad range of space. As an alternative, inertial motion sensing using cheap and small microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMS) based inertial sensors has been proposed. Inertial motion sensing allows ambulatory movement and is also free of occlusion problem. It has been actively studied for recent 2 decades, but until now, most researches have focused on measuring only the kinematics of body segments. In this research, the performance of inertial motion sensing especially aimed at inverse dynamics analysis is studied for squat motion. Kinematic data from inertial motion sensors are used to calculate the normal ground reaction force (GRF), which is evaluated based on the force plate measurement (ground truth) and additionally compared to the estimation result using optical motion sensing system. Squat motion, which can be simply modeled as a 3-segment linkage moving in sagittal plane is targeted. The normal GRF estimation result showed high correlation and low RMSE (R=0.93, RMSE<0.02 of body weight), which guarantees enough accuracy of inertial motion sensing to be used for estimating joint forces\/torques through inverse dynamics analysis about squat. I. INTRODUCTION The information about joint force\/torque of human body while conducting certain movement, is essential to analyze the cause of the movement.[1] The information of joint force\/torque, which originate the movement of joints enables deeper understanding of human motions. For example, the role of each joint and the function of related muscles can be known, and the energy analysis is also available. This joint force\/torque can be directly measured by invasive method [2], but the application is extremely limited. In most cases, inverse dynamics analysis is the only way to get the joint force\/torque information of human motion. The inverse dynamics analysis is based on Newtonian dynamics, as it applies equations of motion of body segments, which are obtained by assuming each body segment as one rigid link model. This analysis requires the inertial parameters and motion information of each body segment. Inertial parameters are usually estimated based on anthropometry [3], and motion information is acquired by motion sensing systems","id":"933a5302-6898-409e-91e1-b3a4dfea8eac"}

Yet, limb joint dynamics do not necessarily reflect muscle dynamics, which dictate whole-body metabolic energy expenditure. Here, we hypothesize that exoskeletons primarily reduce user metabolic energy expenditure across locomotion conditions by reducing active muscle volume. Key Words: energetics, metabolism, augment, locomotion, performance, biomechanics, assistive device  Key Points   Center of mass, limb joint, and muscle mechanical do not explain well how exoskeletons alter locomotion economy.  Limb joint dynamics do not necessarily reflect the underly-  ing muscle dynamics across locomotion conditions.   Active muscles are the primary drivers of whole-body meta- bolic energy expenditure duringlocomotion. Consequently, exoskeletons likely needto consider muscle dynamicstoop- timize locomotion economy.   During walking and hopping with an exoskeleton, muscle force generation is a better correlate to locomotion economy than previously measured mechanical work parameters.  Tracking muscle length changes in vivo may help provide reasonably accurate active muscle volume calculations.  Future exoskeleton controllers may incorporate real-time muscle physiology measures to update device characteristics and maintain minimal active muscle volume and metabolic energy expenditure across locomotion conditions.","id":"1d84fff9-757b-4f69-809f-ada925b3edd7"}

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller. The data indicates that the exoskeleton with controller provided the intended extent of movement coordination, while still allowing the subject to maintain walking balance. Keywords— Gait retraining, hemiparesis, lower limb exoskeleton I. INTRODUCTION Stroke has an annual incidence of approximately 795,000 people in the United States, of which approximately 665,000 survive [1]. Of these, approximately 200,000 annually are affected by lower-extremity hemiparesis to an extent that prevents walking without assistance six months after the stroke (i.e., by the time they enter the chronic stages of stroke) [2]–[4]. The inability to walk unassisted has an obvious impact on an individual’s independence and community dwelling capability, and thus quality of life and continued health. Post-stroke gait impairment is comprised of a number of factors, including muscle weakness, spasticity, and impaired coordination. During the stance phase of the gait cycle, the paretic side is characterized by a shorter stance time due to impaired hip and knee flexion and extension.

Analysis of the Bayesian Gait-State Estimation Problem for Lower-Limb Wearable Robot Sensor Configurations  Roberto Leo Medrano1, Gray Cortright Thomas2, Elliott J. Rouse1, Robert D. Gregg2 1Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Robotics Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA  2Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Robotics Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA  Abstract  Many exoskeletons today are primarily tested in controlled, steady-state laboratory conditions that are unrealistic representations of their real-world usage in which walking conditions (e.g., speed, slope, and stride length) change constantly. One potential solution is to detect these changing walking conditions online using Bayesian state estimation to deliver assistance that continuously adapts to the wearer’s gait. This paper investigates such an approach in silico, aiming to understand 1) which of the various Bayesian filter assumptions best match the problem, and 2) which gait parameters can be feasibly estimated with different combinations of sensors available to different exoskeleton configurations (pelvis, thigh, shank, and\/or foot). Our results suggest that the assumptions of the Extended Kalman Filter are well suited to accurately estimate phase, stride frequency, stride length, and ramp inclination with a wide variety of sparse sensor configurations.

When defining requirements for any wearable robot for walking assistance, it is important to maximize the user’s metabolic benefit resulting from the exosuit assistance while limiting the metabolic penalty of carrying the system’s mass. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the relationship between assistance magnitude and the metabolic cost of walking while also examining changes to the wearer’s underlying gait mechanics. The study was performed with a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit during normal walking, where assistance was di- rectly applied at the ankle joint and indirectly at the hip due to a textile architecture. The exosuit controller was designed such that the delivered torque profile at the ankle joint approximated that of the biological torque during normal walking. Seven participants walked on a treadmill at 1.5 meters per second under one unpowered and four powered conditions, where the peak moment applied at the ankle joint was varied from about 10 to 38% of biological ankle moment (equivalent to an applied force of 18.7 to 75.0% of body weight). Results showed that, with increasing exosuit assistance, net metabolic rate continually decreased within the tested range. When maximum assistance was applied, the metabolic rate of walking was reduced by 22.83 ± 3.17% relative to the powered-off condition (mean ± SEM).","id":"73d129c7-ad0b-4999-9632-4c172fecff6e"}

Myers1,4, Iraklis I. Pipinos4,5, Philippe Malcolm1*  The metabolic rate of walking can be reduced by applying a constant forward force at the center of mass. It has been shown that the metabolically optimal constant force magnitude minimizes propulsion ground reaction force at the expense of increased braking. This led to the hypothesis that selectively assisting propulsion could lead to greater benefits. We used a robotic waist tether to evaluate the effects of forward forces with different timings and magnitudes. Here, we show that it is possible to reduce the metabolic rate of healthy participants by 48% with a greater efficiency ratio of metabolic cost reduction per unit of net aiding work compared with other assistive robots. This result was obtained using a sinusoidal force profile with peak timing during the middle of the double support. The same timing could also reduce the metabolic rate in patients with peripheral artery disease. A model explains that the optimal force profile accelerates the center of mass into the inverted pendulum movement during single support. Contrary to the hypothesis, the optimal force timing did not entirely coincide with propulsion.

Embry, Student Member, IEEE, Dario J. Villarreal, Member, IEEE, Rebecca L. Macaluso, and Robert D. Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Powered knee and ankle prostheses can perform a limited number of discrete ambulation tasks. This is largely due to their control architecture, which uses a ﬁnite-state machine to select among a set of task-speciﬁc controllers. A non-switching controller that supports a continuum of tasks is expected to better facilitate normative biomechanics. This paper introduces a predictive model that represents gait kinematics as a contin- uous function of gait cycle percentage, speed, and incline. The basis model consists of two parts: basis functions that produce kinematic trajectories over the gait cycle, and task functions that smoothly alter the weight of basis functions in response to task. Kinematic data from ten able-bodied subjects walking at twenty-seven combinations of speed and incline generate training and validation data for this data-driven model. Convex optimization accurately ﬁts the model to experimental data. Automated model order reduction improves predictive abilities by capturing only the most important kinematic changes due to walking tasks. Constraints on range of motion and jerk ensure the safety and comfort of the user. This model produces a smooth continuum of trajectories over task, an impossibility for ﬁnite-state control algorithms. Random sub-sampling validation indicates basis modeling predicts untrained kinematics more accurately than linear interpolation.  and minimizing back muscle activation related to the risk of low back pain [1].","id":"4815969f-cf6f-4fb1-8a20-e44477c225e5"}

Murray, Student Member, IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes a hybrid system that combines a powered lower limb exoskeleton with functional electrical stimu- lation (FES) for gait restoration in persons with paraplegia. The general control structure consists of two control loops: a motor control loop, which utilizes joint angle feedback control to control the output of the joint motor to track the desired joint trajecto- ries, and a muscle control loop, which utilizes joint torque proﬁles from previous steps to shape the muscle stimulation proﬁle for the subsequent step in order to minimize the motor torque contribu- tion required for joint angle trajectory tracking. The implementa- tion described here incorporates stimulation of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles, such that the hip joints are actuated by the combination of hip motors and the hamstrings, and the knee joints are actuated by the combination of knee motors and the quadri- ceps. In order to demonstrate efﬁcacy, the control approach was implemented on three paraplegic subjects with motor complete spinal cord injuries ranging from levels T6 to T10.

We introduced a new reinforcement learning (RL) controller for this purpose based on the promising ability of RL controllers to solve optimal control problems through interactions with the environment without requiring an explicit system model. However, collecting data from a human-prosthesis system is expensive and thus the design of a RL controller has to take into account data and time efﬁciency. We therefore propose an ofﬂine policy iteration based reinforcement learning approach. Our solution is built on the ﬁnite state machine (FSM) impedance control framework, which is the most used prosthesis control method in commercial and prototypic robotic prosthesis. Under such a framework, we designed an approximate policy iteration algorithm to devise impedance parameter update rules for 12 prosthesis control parameters in order to meet individual users’ needs. The goal of the reinforcement learning-based control was to reproduce near-normal knee kinematics during gait. We tested the RL controller obtained from ofﬂine learning in real time experiment involving the same able-bodied human subject wearing a robotic lower limb prosthesis. Our results showed that the RL control resulted in good convergent behavior in kinematic states, and the ofﬂine learning control policy successfully adjusted the prosthesis control parameters to produce near-normal knee kinematics in 10 updates of the impedance control parameters.","id":"dd7a0f3b-e6bf-401a-bc73-ae85eb2d67ba"}

Karen Liu2  Abstract—This paper introduces a new planning algorithm to minimize the damage of humanoid falls by utilizing multiple contact points. Given an unstable initial state of the robot, our approach plans for the optimal sequence of contact points such that the initial momentum is dissipated with minimal impacts on the robot. Instead of switching among a collection of individual control strategies, we propose a general algorithm which plans for appropriate responses to a wide variety of falls, from a single step to recover a gentle nudge, to a rolling motion to break a high-speed fall. Our algorithm transforms the falling problem into a sequence of inverted pendulum problems and use dynamic programming to solve the optimization efﬁciently. The planning algorithm is validated in physics simulation and experimentally tested on a BioloidGP humanoid.  I. INTRODUCTION  A humanoid in an interactive environment is often exposed to the risk of falling due to unexpected contacts or perturba- tions. A fall can potentially cause detrimental damage to the robot and enormous cost to repair.

The setup of the mechanomyography (MMG) measurement is simpler than the setup for sur- face electromyography (sEMG) measurement and is less affected by sweating. However, torque estimation based on a mechanomyogram involves signiﬁcant noise, which is an important issue. Therefore, we propose a regression analy- sis method to estimate the torque of the knee joint during voluntary movement based on the MMG signal. The pro- posed method differs from conventional methods because it integrates the MMG sensor responses at four locations: anterior, posterior, and medial\/lateral just above the main operating muscle. This method focuses on the acceleration response characteristics, which change slightly depending on the location of the MMG sensor. Support vector regres- sion was performed on the root mean square (RMS) of the MMG signals, which were processed by a low-pass ﬁlter. Two-channel estimation with an increased number of MMG sensors for the leading and antagonist muscles improved the conventional method, and four-channel estimation with medial and lateral sensors further improved the perfor- mance.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically slow and metabolically expensive. Passive assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses are often prescribed to increase function and independence after stroke; however, walking remains highly impaired despite—and perhaps because of—their use. We sought to determine whether a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to supplement the paretic limb’s residual ability to generate both forward propulsion and ground clearance could facilitate more normal walking after stroke. Exosuits transmit mechanical power generated by actuators to a wearer through the interaction of garment-like, functional textile anchors and cable-based transmissions. We evaluated the immediate effects of an exosuit actively assisting the paretic limb of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery during treadmill and overground walking. Using controlled, treadmill-based biomechanical investigation, we demonstrate that exosuits can function in synchrony with a wearer’s paretic limb to facilitate an immediate 5.33 ± 0.91° increase in the paretic ankle’s swing phase dorsiflexion and 11 ± 3% increase in the paretic limb’s generation of forward propulsion (P < 0.05). These improvements in paretic limb function contributed to a 20 ± 4% reduction in forward propulsion interlimb asymmetry and a 10 ± 3% reduc- tion in the energy cost of walking, which is equivalent to a 32 ± 9% reduction in the metabolic burden associated with poststroke walking. Relatively low assistance (~12% of biological torques) delivered with a lightweight and nonrestrictive exosuit was sufficient to facilitate more normal walking in ambulatory individuals after stroke. Future work will focus on understanding how exosuit-induced improvements in walking performance may be leveraged to improve mobility after stroke.","id":"b762abec-8f90-4986-b433-8e1ccdc95199"}

To improve the performance of BLDC motors, different control methods have been developed by many researchers. Those are such as the field weakening control method, overlapping method, PWM chopping method [3]-[6].  Abstract— The BLDC (Brushless DC) motor is characterized by linear torque to current and speed to voltage. It has low acoustic noise and fast dynamic response. Moreover, it has high power density with high proportion of torque to inertia in spite of small size drive. However, at high-speed operation, torque and speed response characteristic is deteriorated by the motor inductance components in stator windings. It is difficult that the BLDC motor is used to the industrial application requiring a wide range of operating speeds. Phase advance angle control method of different methods used to improve torque and speed response is used widely at high-speed operation. However, conventional phase advance angle control method was considered about forward motoring mode. Therefore, position information error of rotor that reverse motoring mode has phase lag angle of double is occurred. comparing with Consequently, torque performance is destroyed significantly. In this paper, a control method using adjustment of the phase advance angle is proposed. This proposed method improves the torque and speed response characteristic by minimizing delay of current at high-speed operation. Simulated results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparison with the conventional control method.","id":"48d2d09e-12a2-463b-aa98-d71fa131cb1e"}

Powered Hip Exoskeletons can Reduce the User’s Hip and Ankle Muscle Activations during Walking  T. Lenzi, Student Member IEEE, M.C. Carrozza, Member, IEEE, and S.K. Agrawal Member, IEEE  Abstract— In this paper, we study the human locomotor adaptation to the action of a powered exoskeleton providing assistive torque at the user’s hip during walking. To this end, we propose a controller that provides the user’s hip with a fraction of the nominal torque profile, adapted to the specific gait features of the user from Winter’s reference data [34]. The assistive controller has been implemented on the ALEX II exoskeleton and tested on ten healthy subjects. Experimental results show that when assisted by the exoskeleton, users can reduce the muscle effort compared to free walking. Despite providing assistance only to the hip joint, both hip and ankle muscles significantly reduced their activation, indicating a clear tradeoff between hip and ankle strategy to propel walking.  muscle strength and endurance (e.g., myopathies) [14], or lowering the maximum sustainable cardiac effort (e.g., peripheral arterial diseases) [15]. A pathological condition of the lower-limb articulations (e.g., hip pain, osteoarthritis) can result in an onset of pain that reduces the patient’s walking ability as well [16]. In either case, by using an assistive exoskeleton that can reduce the muscle force required to walk, patients might recover their normal movement ability and improve their physical and social health [17]-[19]. The growing elderly population increases the incidence of these pathologies, and together with longer life expectancy, the study of non-pharmacological solutions. motivates Assistive exoskeletons may present an alternative way of restoring normal walking in these population groups.

The OA causes results in joint damage. Knee osteoarthritis is one of the major disease which causes damages in the cartilage between femur and tibia. The patellofemoral region is mainly involved in knee osteoarthritis. The main aim of this study is to measure the forces during the walking movement in left and right part of patello femoral joint for OA patients and normal subjects. The objective is to design a circuit to measure forces and to test the difference between OA patients and normal subjects. The hardware circuit was designed using NI ELVIS ( National Instrument Educational Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Suite), which is used to interface the sensors with the labVIEW software. The labVIEW software is used to acquire data from the sensors. The circuit was designed using two FSR sensors (Force Sensitive Resistor) which are fitted to the upper part of the patellofemoral joint on right and left knee separately. The forces which are obtained by the walking movement within the duration of three minutes. The measured output shows a decrement in force compare to normal and OA subjects and it also has been identified that right knee force is greater than left knee force .

The intended application of the controller is to facilitate gait training for individuals suffering from post-stroke hemiparesis. The controller mimics a kinematic constraint between the knee and hip joints during the swing phase of gait, such that movement is not dependent on time (i.e., step time is determined entirely by the user). The controller additionally incorporates real-time path planning adjustment that allows step length to be adjusted by the user. As such, the controller provides movement coordination, but still enables a user to retain the step-to-step variability required to maintain balance during walking. As a preliminary assessment of efficacy, the controller was implemented on a lower limb exoskeleton and tested on a healthy subject, who walked at varying speeds without the use of a stability aid, with and without the proposed controller. The data indicates that the exoskeleton with controller provided the intended extent of movement coordination, while still allowing the subject to maintain walking balance. Keywords— Gait retraining, hemiparesis, lower limb exoskeleton I. INTRODUCTION Stroke has an annual incidence of approximately 795,000 people in the United States, of which approximately 665,000 survive [1]. Of these, approximately 200,000 annually are affected by lower-extremity hemiparesis to an extent that prevents walking without assistance six months after the stroke (i.e., by the time they enter the chronic stages of stroke) [2]–[4]. The inability to walk unassisted has an obvious impact on an individual’s independence and community dwelling capability, and thus quality of life and continued health. Post-stroke gait impairment is comprised of a number of factors, including muscle weakness, spasticity, and impaired coordination. During the stance phase of the gait cycle, the paretic side is characterized by a shorter stance time due to impaired hip and knee flexion and extension.

We propose a new method combining the strengths of traditional laboratory studies where environment is strictly controlled, and ﬁeld-based studies where subjects behave naturally. We use a foot-mounted inertial sensor, a GPS receiver and a barometric altitude sensor to reconstruct a subject’s path and detailed foot movement, both indoors and outdoors, during days-long measurement using strapdown navigation and sensor fusion algorithms. We cluster repeated movement paths based on location, and propose that on these paths, most environmental and behavioral factors (e.g., terrain and motivation) are as repeatable as in a laboratory. During each bout of movement along a frequently repeated path, any synchronized measurement can be isolated for study, enabling focused statistical comparison of diﬀerent interventions. We conducted a 10-day test on one subject wearing athletic shoes and sandals each for ﬁve days. The algorithm detected four frequently-repeated straight walking paths with at least 300 total steps and repetitions on at least three days for each condition. Results on these frequently-repeated paths indicated signiﬁcantly lower foot clearance and shorter stride length and a trend toward decreased stride width when wearing athletic shoes vs. sandals. Comparisons based on all straight walking were similar, showing greater statistical power, but higher variability in the data. The proposed method oﬀers a new way to evaluate how mobility interventions aﬀect everyday movement behavior.

However, existing assist devices pose problems in terms of coordination between the person and the device owing to misalignment of motion time or device motion trajectory. Therefore, an assist method with a wide range of tolerance for such misalignment is required. In a previous study focusing on viscosity characteristics, the basic assist effect of viscosity in seated motion was verified and its effectiveness was demonstrated. Consequently, the viscosity command was able to provide assistance with a wider range of tolerance for movement time and misalignment between the motion trajectory of the device and the wearer than other command methods. This study examines the assist effect of variable viscosity control in stair descent, which is a complex and cyclic knee joint motion. Experiments were conducted to compare the command signals of the variable viscosity command (proposed method) that adjusts torque based on angular velocity, time command, which modifies the output value over time, and angle command, which alters the command value according to the angle of the device. In addition, a subjective evaluation experiment was conducted using a questionnaire. The results confirmed that the variable viscosity command can accommodate a wider range of tolerance for time deviation and deviation of the motion trajectory of both the person and the device compared to other command methods. I. INTRODUCTION Wearable assist devices are directly attached to a person; therefore, it is important that they synchronize seamlessly with the movements of the wearer. Ideally, similar to human muscles, assist devices should be driven voluntarily. However, accurately reading and driving the intention of the wearer is challenging. Existing assist devices do not drive voluntarily but often output preprogrammed commands based on the information obtained from sensors or perform feedback control using sensor information from the device. However, it is difficult for the wearer to operate the assist device as expected when it is driven by preprogrammed commands based on sensor information. In addition, a discrepancy exists between the expected and actual operations. In the case of feedback control using sensor information from the device, achieving perfect alignment between motion trajectories of the device and the wearer is challenging, resulting in misalignment. This misalignment poses a coordination problem that is difficult to eliminate completely","id":"4a537cce-e886-4562-b898-cfd156f1991b"}

Gutierrez Farewik, and Ruoli Wang  Abstract—In recent decades, there has been an increasing interest in the use of robotic powered exoskeletons to assist patients with movement disorders in rehabilitation and daily life. Providing assistive torque that compensates for the user’s remaining muscle contributions is a growing and challenging ﬁeld within exoskeleton control. In this article, ankle joint torques were estimated using electromyography (EMG)-driven neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) model and an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) model in seven movement tasks, including fast walking, slow walking, self-selected speed walking, and isokinetic dorsi\/plantar ﬂexion at 60◦\/s and 90◦\/s. In each method, EMG signals and ankle joint angles were used as input, the models were trained with data from 3-D motion analysis, and ankle joint torques were predicted. Six cases using different motion trials as calibration (for the NMS model)\/training (for the ANN) were devised, and the agreement between the predicted and measured ankle joint torques was computed. We found that the NMS model could overall better predict ankle joint torques from EMG and angle data than the ANN model with some exceptions; the ANN predicted ankle joint torques with better agreement when trained with data from the same movement. The NMS model predicted ankle joint torque best when calibrated with trials during which EMG reached maximum levels, whereas the ANN predicted well when trained with many trials and types of movements. In addition, the ANN prediction may become less reliable when  predicting unseen movements. Detailed comparative studies of methods to predict ankle joint torque are crucial for determining strategies for exoskeleton control.","id":"71c940c2-8178-48dc-928c-ac46acb85e7f"}

Yet, limb joint dynamics do not necessarily reflect muscle dynamics, which dictate whole-body metabolic energy expenditure. Here, we hypothesize that exoskeletons primarily reduce user metabolic energy expenditure across locomotion conditions by reducing active muscle volume.

Martinez-Hernandez,3 H. Kim,3 S. K. Agrawal1,3*  Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science. No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Children with cerebral palsy commonly exhibit an abnormality called crouch gait, which is characterized by exces- sive flexion of the hips\/knees and weak plantar flexor muscles during the stance phase. One of the major reasons for this pathological gait is weakness in soleus muscles. During the mid-stance phase of gait when the toe and heel are both on the ground, the soleus keeps the shank upright and facilitates extension of the knee angle. It also provides propulsive forces on the body during the late stance phase of the gait cycle. We hypothesized that walk- ing with downward pelvic pull will (i) strengthen extensor muscles, especially the soleus, against the applied downward force and (ii) improve muscle coordination during walking. We then tested a robotic training paradigm to improve both posture and gait of children with crouch gait. In this paradigm, participants with crouch gait were subjected to downward pelvic force when walking on a treadmill, provided by a cable-driven robot called Tethered Pelvic Assist Device. Electromyography of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles and walking kinematics of the partici- pants showed the feasibility of this training, enhanced upright posture of the participants, and improved muscle coordination. In addition, walking features of these participants, such as increased step length, range of motion of the lower limb angles, toe clearance, and heel-to-toe pattern, improved. This robotic training method can be a promising intervention for children with cerebral palsy who have a crouch gait.  INTRODUCTION In the United States, 3.6 children out of every 1000 school-aged chil- dren have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) (1). These children show abnormal gait patterns, for example, jump gait, equinus gait, and crouch gait (2, 3). The crouch gait is characterized by excessive flexion of the hips, knees, or ankles (2, 4, 5). Children with crouch have slow walking speed, reduced range of motion of the joints (ROM), small step length, large body sway, and absence of a heel strike (6). In addition to other complications, crouch gait increases the energy cost of walking, causes pain, and results in joint degeneration over time (7).","id":"c1b9d70d-d598-46de-9927-e5bdad3bc64f"}

Young  Abstract—Lower limb exoskeletons provide assistance during the gait cycle using a state variable, one in particular is gait phase. This is crucial for the exoskeleton controller to provide the user accurate assistance. Conventional methods often utilize an event marker to estimate gait phase by computing the average stride time. However, this strategy has limitations in adapting to dynamic speeds. We developed a sensor fusion-based neural network model to estimate the gait phase in real-time that can adapt to dynamic speeds ranging from 0.6 to 1.1 m\/s. Ten able- bodied subjects walked with an exoskeleton using our estimator and were provided with corresponding torque assistance. Our best performing model had RMSE below 29 ms and 4% for real-time estimation and torque generation, respectively, reducing the estimation error by 36.0% (p < 0.01) and torque error by 40.9% (p < 0.001) compared to conventional methods. Our results indicate that creating a general user-independent model and additionally training on user-speciﬁc data outperforms the user- speciﬁc model and user-independent model. Our study validates the feasibility of using a sensor fusion-based machine learning model to accurately estimate the user’s gait phase and improve the controllability of a lower limb exoskeleton.

When defining requirements for any wearable robot for walking assistance, it is important to maximize the user’s metabolic benefit resulting from the exosuit assistance while limiting the metabolic penalty of carrying the system’s mass. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the relationship between assistance magnitude and the metabolic cost of walking while also examining changes to the wearer’s underlying gait mechanics. The study was performed with a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit during normal walking, where assistance was di- rectly applied at the ankle joint and indirectly at the hip due to a textile architecture. The exosuit controller was designed such that the delivered torque profile at the ankle joint approximated that of the biological torque during normal walking. Seven participants walked on a treadmill at 1.5 meters per second under one unpowered and four powered conditions, where the peak moment applied at the ankle joint was varied from about 10 to 38% of biological ankle moment (equivalent to an applied force of 18.7 to 75.0% of body weight). Results showed that, with increasing exosuit assistance, net metabolic rate continually decreased within the tested range. When maximum assistance was applied, the metabolic rate of walking was reduced by 22.83 ± 3.17% relative to the powered-off condition (mean ± SEM).  INTRODUCTION Humans naturally walk in a manner that conserves energy; we opti- mize our cadence, step length, and arm swing to minimize metabolic energy consumption (1, 2). It is a commonly held belief that devia- tions from this normal walking pattern increase energy expenditure (3, 4). Certain diseases that affect gait, such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy, increase the net energy expenditure of walking by as much as 70% compared with healthy individuals (5–7). In addition, the energy expenditure of healthy individuals increases under strenuous activities, such as walking uphill or carrying heavy loads (8, 9). Such increases in metabolic consumption could lead to greater levels of fatigue and injury. For patient populations, the added effort could also decrease community involvement.","id":"22c71574-ad2f-4a42-bef8-dc3dad88234c"}

This paper presents a torque controller for an ankle exoskeleton that uses state estimation with a data-driven kinematic model to continuously estimate the phase, phase rate, stride length, and ramp parameters during locomotion. The controller applies torque assistance based on the estimated phase and adapts the torque proﬁle based on the estimated task variables to match human torques observed in a multi-activity database of 10 able-bodied subjects. We demonstrate in silico that the controller yields phase estimates that are more accurate than state of the art, while also estimating task variables with compa- rable accuracy to recent machine learning approaches.

Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Compared to rigid actuators, Series Elastic Ac- tuators (SEAs) offer a potential reduction of motor energy consumption and peak power, though these beneﬁts are highly dependent on the design of the torque-elongation proﬁle of the elastic element. In the case of linear springs, natural dynamics is a traditional method for this design, but it has two major limitations: arbitrary load trajectories are difﬁcult or impossible to analyze and it does not consider actuator constraints. Paramet- ric optimization is also a popular design method that addresses these limitations, but solutions are only optimal within the space of the parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-parametric convex optimization program for the design of the nonlinear elastic element that minimizes energy consumption and peak power for an arbitrary periodic reference trajectory. To obtain convexity, we introduce a convex approximation to the expression of peak power; energy consumption is shown to be convex without approximation. The combination of peak power and energy consumption in the cost function leads to a multiobjective convex optimization framework that comprises the main contribution of this paper. As a case study, we recover the elongation-torque proﬁle of a cubic spring, given its natural oscillation as the reference load. We then design nonlinear SEAs for an ankle prosthesis that minimize energy consumption and peak power for different trajectories and extend the range of achievable tasks when subject to actuator constraints.

ACCEPTED JUNE, 2020 1  Abstract— Lower-limb exoskeletons are widely researched to improve walking performance and mobility. Low-level sensor-less exoskeleton motor control is attractive for consumer applications due to reduced device complexity and cost, but complex and variable transmission system configurations make the development of effective open-loop motor controllers that are responsive to user input challenging. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an open-loop motor control framework resulting in similar or greater performance vs. closed-loop torque control. We used generalized linear regression to develop two open-loop controllers by modeling motor current during exoskeleton-assisted walking; a “complex” model used desired torque and estimated ankle angular velocity as inputs, while a “simple” model used desired torque alone. Five participants walked at 1.0-1.3 m\/s on a treadmill with closed-loop and both open-loop controllers providing ankle exoskeleton assistance. Both open-loop current controllers had similar root-mean-squared torque tracking error (p=0.23) compared to the closed-loop torque-feedback controller. Both open-loop controllers had improved relative average torque production (p<0.001 complex, p=0.022 simple), lower power consumption (p<0.001 for both), and reduced operating noise (p=0.002 complex, p<0.001 simple) over the closed-loop controller. New control models developed for a different ankle exoskeleton configuration showed similar improvements (lower torque error, greater average and peak torque production, lower power consumption) over closed-loop control during over-ground walking. These results demonstrate that our framework can produce open-loop motor controllers that match closed-loop control performance during exoskeleton operation.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Zachary F. Lerner, Diane L. Damiano, Thomas C. Bulea*  The ability to walk contributes considerably to physical health and overall well-being, particularly in children with motor disability, and is therefore prioritized as a rehabilitation goal. However, half of ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent childhood movement disorder, cease to walk in adulthood. Robotic gait trainers have shown positive outcomes in initial studies, but these clinic-based systems are limited to short- term programs of insufficient length to maintain improved function in a lifelong disability such as CP. Sophisticated wearable exoskeletons are now available, but their utility in treating childhood movement dis- orders remains unknown. We evaluated an exoskeleton for the treatment of crouch (or flexed-knee) gait, one of the most debilitating pathologies in CP. We show that the exoskeleton reduced crouch in a cohort of ambula- tory children with CP during overground walking. The exoskeleton was safe and well tolerated, and all children were able to walk independently with the device. Rather than guiding the lower limbs, the exoskeleton dynam- ically changed the posture by introducing bursts of knee extension assistance during discrete portions of the walking cycle, a perturbation that resulted in maintained or increased knee extensor muscle activity during exoskeleton use. Six of seven participants exhibited postural improvements equivalent to outcomes reported from invasive orthopedic surgery. We also demonstrate that improvements in crouch increased over the course of our multiweek exploratory trial. Together, these results provide evidence supporting the use of wearable exoskeletons as a treatment strategy to improve walking in children with CP.","id":"4094a703-5030-44a2-9210-896044439fb7"}

In this article, we describe a lightweight and low-power clutch that operates with electrostatic adhe- sion and achieves order-of-magnitude improvements in performance compared to traditional clutches. In order to inform appropriate design in a variety of applications, we experimentally determine the effect of clutch length, width, dielectric thickness, voltage, and electrode stiffness on the holding force, engage and release times, and power consump- tion. The highest performance clutch held 190 N, weighed 15 g, and consumed 3.2 mW of power. The best samples released and engaged within 20 ms, as fast as conventional clutches. We also conducted a fatigue test that showed reli- able performance for over 3 million cycles.

Accu- rate force\/torque sensing is necessary to measure the physical interaction between the user, the prosthesis, and the environment. Most available solutions consist of retroﬁtting an off-the-shelf load cell, which leads to suboptimal designs regarding weight and size, ultimately reducing the prosthesis usability. To address this limitation, we propose to instrument an existing prosthesis component, namely, a pyramid adapter, with force\/torque sensing and an inertial measurement unit. Magnetic sensing of large structural deformations is used to improve system reliability and reduce costs. Testing shows that the proposed sensor prototype can sense up to 120 Nm and 2500 N of torque and force and has 2.1% and 8.3% nonlinearity, respectively, during walking. The total weight is 150 g—only 66 g more than a standard pyramid adapter without force\/torque instrumentation. Amputee testing with robotic leg prosthesis is conducted to validate the instrumented pyramid in a case scenario.  the physical interaction between the user, the prosthesis, and the environment.  The development of force\/torque sensors for prosthetic applications requires satisfying competing design requirements in terms of a wide force and torque range and a small, lightweight package. During common ambulation activities, torque and force at the ankle, normalized by the user’s body weight, peak at about 1.7 Nm\/kg and 11.4 N\/kg [10], respectively. This relatively wide range of torque and force is easier to satisfy if the sensor dimensions and weight are not critical. However, in prosthetic applications, the size of the force\/torque sensor affects the overall prosthesis dimensions, especially the build height, which ultimately determines how many people can use the prosthesis [11]. Moreover, increasing the prosthesis weight affects gait negatively by increasing metabolic consumption and muscle effort [12], [13]. As a result, it is important to minimize build height and weight in sensors used for prosthetic applications.  Index Terms—Ambulation, force\/torque sensing, prosthetics.  I.

Nowadays, the proper alignment of knee mechanical axis and the perfect equalization of ﬂexion and extension gaps are ensured by computer-assisted TKA (CATKA). Nevertheless, any residual im- balance of collateral ligaments at the time of surgery can lead to an excessive imbalance in the postoperative period during the weight- bearing activities, which subject the knee collateral ligaments to increased loading. This in turn leads to an accelerated polyethylene wear, and consequently, to early failure of TKA. The instrumented tibialimplantproposedinthisstudycanpostoperativelyassessand monitor the progression of residual postoperative ligament imbal- ance of a prosthetic knee, which is perfectly aligned during the surgery thanks to CATKA, via a center-of-pressure (COP)-based approach. This approach depends on the measurement of relative displacementofCOPpositionduringthepostoperativeperiodwith respect to a reference position recorded at the beginning of this pe- riod. This measurement is performed for six predetermined ﬂexion angles representative of an entire gait cycle. The tibial implant can also generate the electrical power in addition to their role in mon- itoring the COP position thanks to the piezoceramics embedded within the tibial tray to achieve this twofold task.

In response to this opportunity, recent work on human-in-the-loop optimization has considered the problem of automatically tuning control parameters based on realtime physiological measurements. However, the common use of metabolic cost as a performance metric cre- ates significant experimental challenges due to its long measurement times and low signal- to-noise ratio. We evaluate the use of Bayesian optimization—a family of sample-efficient, noise-tolerant, and global optimization methods—for quickly identifying near-optimal control parameters. To manage experimental complexity and provide comparisons against related work, we consider the task of minimizing metabolic cost by optimizing walking step frequen- cies in unaided human subjects. Compared to an existing approach based on gradient descent, Bayesian optimization identified a near-optimal step frequency with a faster time to convergence (12 minutes, p < 0.01), smaller inter-subject variability in convergence time (± 2 minutes, p < 0.01), and lower overall energy expenditure (p < 0.01).","id":"83c48c6d-c03a-4873-9a50-7abe971973c0"}

L. Philip Chen , Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—A novel neuro-fuzzy model named fuzzy broad learning system (BLS) is proposed by merging the Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system into BLS. The fuzzy BLS replaces the feature nodes of BLS with a group of TS fuzzy subsystems, and the input data are processed by each of them. Instead of aggregating the outputs of fuzzy rules produced by every fuzzy subsystem into one value immediately, all of them are sent to the enhance- ment layer for further nonlinear transformation to preserve the characteristic of inputs. The defuzziﬁcation outputs of all fuzzy subsystem and the outputs of enhancement layer are combined together to obtain the model output. The k-means method is employed to determine the centers of Gaussian membership func- tions in antecedent part and the number of fuzzy rules. The parameters that need to be calculated in a fuzzy BLS are the weights connecting the outputs of enhancement layer to model output and the randomly initialized coefﬁcients of polynomials in consequent part in fuzzy subsystems, which can be calculated analytically. Therefore, fuzzy BLS retains the fast computational nature of BLS. The proposed fuzzy BLS is evaluated by some pop- ular benchmarks for regression and classiﬁcation, and compared with some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches. The results indicate that fuzzy BLS outperforms other models involved. Moreover, fuzzy BLS shows advantages over neuro- fuzzy models regarding to the number of fuzzy rules and training time, which can ease the problem of rule explosion to some extent.  I.

The transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible beneﬁts over modern actuation styles in emerging robotic prosthetic legs, which include free- swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, less acoustic noise, and power regeneration. Benchtop tests establish that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (∼1-3 Nm) and conﬁrm the small reﬂected inertia. Impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufﬁciently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback or lengthy tuning trials. Walking experiments validate performance under the designed loading conditions with minimal tuning. Lastly, the regenerative abilities, low friction, and small reﬂected inertia of the presented actuators reduced power con- sumption and acoustic noise compared to state-of-art powered legs.

INTRODUCTION  Use of conventional passive prostheses after lower-limb loss results in gait that is slower, less stable, and less energy efﬁ- cient than able-bodied locomotion [1], [2]. Passive prostheses aim to alleviate the effects of amputation using mechanisms such as springs, cams, and dampers to mimic normative gait patterns. However, passive prostheses are limited in function- ality due to the fact that such mechanisms can only dissipate energy that the user introduces. Although these passive devices restore some functionality, amputees are typically left with an asymmetric gait [3].

Mechanical Engineering The University of Texas at Dallas Richardson, Texas 75080 Email: rgregg@utdallas.edu  ABSTRACT  Having uniﬁed representations of human walking gait data is of paramount importance for wearable robot control. In the rehabilitation robotics literature, control approaches that unify the gait cycle of wearable robots are more appealing than the conventional approaches that rely on dividing the gait cycle into several periods, each with their own distinct controllers. In this article we propose employing algebraic curves to represent hu- man walking data for wearable robot controller design. In or- der to generate algebraic curves from human walking data, we employ the 3L ﬁtting algorithm, a tool developed in the pattern recognition literature for ﬁtting implicit polynomial curves to gi- ven datasets. For an impedance model of the knee joint motion driven by the hip angle signal, we provide conditions by which the generated algebraic curves satisfy a robust relative degree condition throughout the entire walking gait cycle. The robust re- lative degree property makes the algebraic curve representation of walking gaits amenable to various nonlinear output tracking controller design techniques.  non-uniﬁed representations of walking gait result in dozens of control parameters and transition rules that must be tuned across users and activities [13]. Furthermore, desynchronizing pertur- bations increase a patient’s risk of falling if the controller swit- ches to the wrong state and as a result uses the wrong control scheme.","id":"e9bba3a7-dd04-4127-97bd-7631776469e8"}

This study aimed to evaluate the effec- tiveness of our exoskeleton in assisting squatting motion using the COP variability as a metric. Six human subjects performed alternate squatting and standing movements while their foot pressure and COP trajecto- ries were recorded using insole pressure sensors. The exercises were performed under three conditions: i) no device, ii) unpowered device, and iii) device with optimal stiffness. Results showed that the variability of the COP trajectory in the anterior-posterior direction of the foot during squatting tended to be lower for the optimal stiffness condition than the no device and unpowered device conditions, indicating the potential usefulness of the device in improving balance during squatting. This study has implications for human-in- the-loop optimization and balance control of the exoskeleton based on COP.  INTRODUCTION  Squatting exercises are frequently used in resistance train- ing and rehabilitation to help people recover from injuries to their lower extremities (McGinty, Irrgang, & Pezzullo, 2000; Yu, Kumar, Turk, & Liu, 2019). Squatting is a symmetric bi- lateral exercise, which can be used to strengthen muscles on one or both sides of the body, depending on patient needs (Luo et al., 2021). Perhaps, squat exercise can be further motivated with a reliable lower extremity exoskeleton, instead of human aids. Such exoskeletons typically employ model-based control methods as balance controller designs (Shi, Zhang, Zhang, & Ding, 2019; Xiong, 2014). Such methods, however, are not very robust against large and unexpected perturbations caused by human interactions (Luo et al., 2021). In other words, un- predictable human-exoskeleton interaction forces and perturba- tions may cause conventional balance controllers to operate un- reliably.","id":"fa17515f-ccbe-4399-b289-d7a45c7042da"}

Direct comparison studies are needed to determine how users respond to different types of control. The purpose of this study was to compare user performance using a robotic hip exoskeleton with two different controllers: a controller that targeted a biological hip torque profile and a proportional myoelectric controller.  Edited by: Jan Veneman, Tecnalia, Spain  Reviewed by: Laurent Simon, New Jersey Institute of Technology, United States Fausto Antonio Panizzolo, Harvard University, United States  Methods: We tested both control approaches on 10 able-bodied subjects using a pneu- matically powered hip exoskeleton. The state machine controller targeted a biological hip torque profile. The myoelectric controller used electromyography (EMG) of lower limb muscles to produce a proportional control signal for the hip exoskeleton. Each subject performed two 30-min exoskeleton walking trials (1.0 m\/s) using each controller and a 10-min trial with the exoskeleton unpowered. During each trial, we measured subjects’ metabolic cost of walking, lower limb EMG profiles, and joint kinematics and kinetics (torques and powers) using a force treadmill and motion capture.

Villarreal, Student Member, IEEE, Hasan A. Poonawala, Member, IEEE and Robert D. Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—The phase of human gait is difﬁcult to quantify accurately in the presence of disturbances. In contrast, recent bipedal robots use time-independent controllers relying on a mechanical phase variable to synchronize joint patterns through the gait cycle. This concept has inspired studies to determine if human joint patterns can also be parameterized by a mechanical variable. Although many phase variable candidates have been proposed, it remains unclear which, if any, provide a robust representation of phase for human gait analysis or control. In this paper we analytically derive an ideal phase variable (the hip phase angle) that is provably monotonic and bounded throughout the gait cycle. To examine the robustness of this phase variable, ten able-bodied human subjects walked over a platform that randomly applied phase-shifting perturbations to the stance leg. A statistical analysis found the correlations between nominal and perturbed joint trajectories to be signiﬁcantly greater when parameterized by the hip phase angle (0.95+) than by time or a different phase variable. The hip phase angle also best parameterized the transient errors about the nominal periodic interlimb phasing was best explained by local orbit. Finally, (ipsilateral) hip phase angles that are synchronized during the double-support period.  Index Terms—Phase, human gait, perturbations, nonlinear  dynamics and control  I.

Walsh 可穿戴髋关节模块 运动辅助 自适应控制","content":"Abstract— This paper presents a modular, computationally-distributed “multi-robot” cyberphysical system designed to assist children with developmental delays in learning to walk. The system consists of two modules, each assisting a different aspect of gait: a tethered cable pelvic module with up to 6 degrees of freedom (DOF), which can modulate the motion of the pelvis in three dimensions, and a two DOF wearable hip module assisting lower limb motion, specifically hip flexion. Both modules are designed to be lightweight and minimally restrictive to the user, and the modules can operate independently or in cooperation with each other, allowing flexible system configuration to provide highly customized and adaptable assistance. Motion tracking performance of approximately 2 mm root mean square (RMS) error for the pelvic module and less than 0.1 mm RMS error for the hip module was achieved. We demonstrate coordinated operation of the two modules on a mannequin test platform with articulated and instrumented lower limbs. I. INTRODUCTION Developmental delay due to premature birth is a major public health problem in the United States [1]. One and a half percent of the more than 4.25 million infants born annually in the U.S. have a very low birth weight [2], and of the 90% that survive, 25-50% suffer a brain injury resulting in development of locomotor delays [3]–[5]. Cerebral palsy (CP) is one manifestation of these locomotor delays and the most common childhood disability that causes lifelong physical impairment, affecting an average of 3.1 per 1000 children in the US [6]. As fundamental motor skills are typically acquired in the early stages of development [7], early intervention is critical, and may help prevent or mitigate development of abnormal movement patterns that lead to secondary musculoskeletal *This research is supported by NSF grant 1329363, by the Harvard John A.

A person with a healthy knee can able to walk freely without any pain in the knee joint but factors like ageing, osteoarthritis can damage the meniscus, articular cartilage and can cause increased compression between the bone which results in knee pain. This compression between the bones can be reduced by extending the knee joint which can provide pain relief. In this proposed method, an exoskeleton knee extension system for transferring the whole-body weight to shoe and an actuating mechanism is designed to extend the knee joint. NodeMCU ESP8266 controller is used to receive feedback from the load cell to drive the motor which provides extension. Only a prototype of is proposed. The necessary extension device extension has been achieved with this prototype and it lifted up to 17 kg. The placements of cuff in the thigh and shank region provided proper grip such that the upper body weight is transferred to the shoe. This is a prototype model and it can be further developed into a clinical device and the extension in the knee joint can be tested by proper clinical trials in future.

Methods: The classification method employs a phase-variable description of gait, and identifies a given activity based on the expected curvature characteristics of that activity over a gait cycle. The classification method was tested in experiments conducted with seven healthy subjects performing three different locomotor activities: level ground walking, stair descent, and stair ascent. Classification accuracy of the phase variable classification method was assessed for classifying each activity, and transitions between activities, and compared to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier as a benchmark. Results: For the subjects tested, the phase variable classification method outperformed LDA when using non-subject- specific training data, while the LDA outperformed the phase variable approach when using training. Conclusions: The proposed method may provide improved classification accuracy for gait classification applications trained with non-subject-specific data. Significance: This paper offers a new method of gait classification based on a phase variable description.

Azocar, Student Member, IEEE and Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE    Abstract—Objective: Recently, human joint impedance—the instantaneous mechanical response to a perturbation—has been quantified during gait, providing new insight beyond the traditional biomechanical descriptions of kinetics and kinematics. However, the role of joint impedance in neuromotor control and the development of exoskeletons and other wearable robotic systems remains unknown. One approach to studying the role of impedance in neuromotor control involves characterizing the human ability to discriminate changes in external impedance properties. Thus, the purpose of this work is to quantify the minimum detectable change in the stiffness component of interacting with an external mechanical impedance when impedance at the human ankle or knee. Methods: A dynamometer coupled to subjects’ right ankle or knee rendered the dynamics of a virtual rotational spring-damper system. The minimum detectable change, or just noticeable difference, was determined via a weighted up-down staircase method in which subjects compared the stiffness values of two different controller configurations. Results: We found that subjects could reliably detect stiffness changes of at least 12% at the ankle and 13% at the knee. Conclusion: Stiffness errors or variations produced by an external mechanical device will be undetected if they remain below the 12% to 13% threshold. Significance: Our results provide novel insight into how the sensorimotor system senses joint impedance, information which may improve the design and control of impedance-based wearable robotic technologies.","id":"3361267d-2a87-4483-8231-ff05c76d93e2"}

Young, Anirban Mazumdar  Abstract—New human-centric approaches to safety can combine over-head camera views with situational awareness tools to enable humans to avoid rapidly evolving threats such as moving machines or falling debris. This paper explores how 360⁰ information can be used to inform humans of potential collisions. Specifically, we quantify how different individual (tactile, audio, and visual) and combined cue modalities affect failure rates and reaction times. Human-subject experiments were conducted in a custom virtual reality environment that simulates objects rapidly moving toward the subject. In order to successfully perform their task, the human subject must physically move their body out of the path of the moving threat before a collision occurs. This exploration of full-body physical response differentiates from previous related studies. The results of the 18-subject study provide quantified data on a range of cues and cue combinations. The study quantified failure rates and reaction times as a function of index of difficulty (Fitt’s Law) and threat directionality. The results confirm the hypothesis that the addition of tactile cues improve performance compared to non-tactile statistically cues with regards to failure rate and reaction time. This demonstrates how sensory cues can improve human physical response to rapid threats.  this work  Index Terms—tactile feedback, situational awareness, virtual  reality, sensory augmentation, human-machine communication.

T., Bartlett, H.L., and Goldfarb M., Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes the design of a new type of knee prosthesis called a stance-control, swing-assist (SCSA) knee prosthesis. The device is motivated by the recognition that energetically-passive stance-controlled microprocessor-controlled knees (SCMPKs) offer many desirable characteristics, such as quiet operation, low weight, high-impedance stance support, and an inertially-driven swing-phase motion. Due to the latter, however, SCMPKs are also highly susceptible to swing-phase perturbations, which can increase the likelihood of falling. The SCSA prosthesis supplements the behavior of an SCMPK with a small motor that maintains the low output impedance of the SCMPK swing state, while adding a supplemental closed-loop controller around it. This paper elaborates upon the motivation for the SCSA prosthesis, describes the design of a prosthesis prototype, and provides human-subject testing data that demonstrates potential device benefits relative to an SCMPK during both non-perturbed and perturbed walking.  Index Terms—Transfemoral, controlled knee, MPK, biomechanics, amputation  prosthesis, microprocessor-  Swing phase is achieved in SCMPKs via inertial coupling between the double-pendulum of the thigh and shank (i.e., forward acceleration of the thigh drives initial knee flexion, while deceleration of the thigh drives subsequently knee extension). A small amount of damping at the knee (relative to the level of stance damping employed in stance-controlled knees) limits excessive knee flexion during swing and avoids terminal impact at full knee extension. One of the substantial benefits of the inertial coupling-based swing-phase movement of passive knee prostheses is that the movement of the knee is naturally and fundamentally coordinated with the movement and intent of the wearer. The same property that enables this natural coordination, however, also makes the swing-phase movement highly-susceptible to perturbations. Specifically, the same low impedance characteristic that enables the wearer to easily enables environmental disturbances, such as stumble or scuff, to substantially influence the movement of the knee. Stance-knee stability relies on full extension at terminal swing, and thus, lack of robustness in swing phase jeopardizes stance-knee stability.  generate  swing-phase motion,  also  I.

Using a light-weight, low- profile bilateral knee exoskeleton system, this study examined and compared the biomechanical effects of three common assistance strategies impedance, and proportional myoelectric controllers) exhibiting different levels of flexibility for the user to control the assistance. Nine subjects walked on a 15% gradient incline surface at 1.1 m\/s in the three powered conditions and with the exoskeleton unpowered. All the assistance strategies significantly reduced the metabolic cost of the users compared to the unpowered condition by 3.0% on average across strategies (p < 0.05), led by the significant reduction in the biological knee kinetic effort and knee extensor muscle activation (p < 0.05). Between assistance strategies, the metabolic cost and biomechanics displayed no statistically significant differences. The metabolic and biomechanical results indicate that powered extension assistance during early stance can improve performance compared to the unpowered condition. However, the user’s ability to control the assistance may not be significant for human augmentation when walking on an inclined surface with a knee exoskeleton.

I‑Chieh Lee1*  , Bretta L. Fylstra1, Ming Liu1, Tommaso Lenzi2 and He Huang1  Abstract Background: Energy cost minimization has been widely accepted to regulate gait. Optimization principles have been frequently used to explain how individuals adapt their gait pattern. However, there have been rare attempts to account for the role of variability in this optimization process. Motor redundancy can enable individuals to perform tasks reliably while achieving energy optimization. However, we do not know how the non‑goal‑equivalent and goal‑ equivalent variability is regulated. In this study, we investigated how unilateral transfemoral amputees regulate step and stride variability based on the task to achieve energy economy.  Methods: Nine individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputation walked on a treadmill at speeds of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 m\/s using their prescribed passive prostheses. We calculated the step‑to‑step and stride‑to‑stride variability and applied goal equivalent manifold (GEM) based control to decompose goal‑equivalent and non‑goal‑equivalent manifold. To quantify the energy economy, the energy recovery rate (R) was calculated based on potential energy and kinetic energy. Comparisons were made between GEM variabilities and commonly used standard deviation measure‑ ments. A linear regression model was used to investigate the trade‑off between R and GEM variabilities.  Results: Our analysis shows greater variability along the goal‑equivalent manifold compared to the non‑goal‑ equivalent manifold (p < 0.001). Moreover, our analysis shows lower energy recovery rate for amputee gait compared to nonamputee gait (at least 20% less at faster walking speed). We found a negative relationship between energy recovery rate and non‑goal‑equivalent variability. Compared to the standard deviation measurements, the variability decomposed using GEM reflected the preferred walking speed and the limitation of the passive prosthetic device.","id":"8d51c9d8-b604-47f5-a718-baca25209ba3"}

First published January 6, 2011; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.00505.2010.—Muscles expend energy to perform active work during locomotion, but they may also expend signiﬁcant energy to produce force, for example when tendons perform much of the work passively. The relative contribu- tions of work and force to overall energy expenditure are unknown. We therefore measured the mechanics and energetics of a cyclical bouncing task, designed to control for work and force. We hypothe- sized that near bouncing resonance, little work would be performed actively by muscle, but the cyclical production of force would cost substantial metabolic energy. Human subjects (n  9) bounced vertically about the ankles at inversely proportional frequencies (1–4 Hz) and amplitudes (15–4 mm), such that the overall rate of work performed on the body remained approximately constant (0.30  0.06 W\/kg), but the forces varied considerably. We used parameter iden- tiﬁcation to estimate series elasticity of the triceps surae tendon, as well as the work performed actively by muscle and passively by tendon. Net metabolic energy expenditure for bouncing at 1 Hz was 1.15  0.31 W\/kg, attributable mainly to active muscle work with an efﬁciency of 24  3%. But at 3 Hz (near resonance), most of the work was performed passively, so that active muscle work could account for only 40% of the net metabolic rate of 0.76  0.28 W\/kg. Near resonance, a cost for cyclical force that increased with both amplitude and frequency of force accounted for at least as much of the total energy expenditure as a cost for work. Series elasticity reduces the need for active work, but energy must still be expended for force production.  elastic energy; movement efﬁciency; resonant frequency","id":"69e33309-38e1-4f86-acc7-fd4c40647413"}

Emerging automatic tuning algorithms have shown promise to ease the device personalization procedure. However, very few automatic tuning algorithms consider the user preference as the tuning goal, which may limit the adoptability of the robotic prosthesis. In this study, we propose and evaluate a novel prosthesis control tun- ing framework for a robotic knee prosthesis, which could enable user preferred robot behavior in the device tuning process. The framework consists of 1) a User-Controlled Interface that allows the user to select their preferred knee kinematics in gait and 2) a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for tuning high-dimension prosthesis control parameters to meet the desired knee kinematics. We evalu- ated the performance of the framework along with usabil- ity of the developed user interface. In addition, we used the developed framework to investigate whether amputee users can exhibit a preference between different profiles during walking and whether they can differentiate between their preferred profile and other profiles when blinded. The results showed effectiveness of our developed framework in tuning 12 robotic knee prosthesis control parameters while meeting the user-selected knee kinematics. A blinded comparative study showed that users can accurately and consistently identify their preferred prosthetic control knee profile. Further, we preliminarily examined gait biomechan- ics of the prosthesis users when walking with different prosthesis control and did not find clear difference between walking with preferred prosthesis control and when walking with normative gait control parameters.

Robotic technology has developed rapidly in recent years, and several robot-assisted gait devices were developed to enhance gait function and activities of daily living in elderly adults and patients with gait disorders. In this study, we investigated the effects of the Gait-enhancing Mechatronic System (GEMS), a new wearable robotic hip-assist device developed by Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd., Korea, on gait performance and foot pressure distribution in elderly adults. Methods: Thirty elderly adults who had no neurological or musculoskeletal abnormalities affecting gait participated in this study. A three-dimensional (3D) motion capture system, surface electromyography and the F-Scan system were used to collect data on spatiotemporal gait parameters, muscle activity and foot pressure distribution under three conditions: free gait without robot assistance (FG), robot-assisted gait with zero torque (RAG-Z) and robot- assisted gait (RAG). Results: We found increased gait speed, cadence, stride length and single support time in the RAG condition. Reduced rectus femoris and medial gastrocnemius muscle activity throughout the terminal stance phase and reduced effort of the medial gastrocnemius muscle throughout the pre-swing phase were also observed in the RAG condition. In addition, walking with the assistance of GEMS resulted in a significant increase in foot pressure distribution, specifically in maximum force and peak pressure of the total foot, medial masks, anterior masks and posterior masks. Conclusion: The results of the present study reveal that GEMS may present an alternative way of restoring age- related changes in gait such as gait instability with muscle weakness, reduced step force and lower foot pressure in elderly adults. In addition, GEMS improved gait performance by improving push-off power and walking speed and reducing muscle activity in the lower extremities.  Trial registration: NCT02843828.

Controllers that vary knee swing speed have been shown to restore gait symmetry with a powered knee and ankle prosthesis. This study  was to combine an existing variable speed knee swing controller with an existing impedance stance controller to determine if comfortable walking with variable cadence can be achieved and if the control method transitions would be noticeable to the user. The knee swing trajectory and duration was varied based on user walking speed as a function of the previous stance phase duration. Four transfemoral amputations were fit with a powered knee and ankle prosthesis. After 3045 minutes of practice walking with the variable knee swing controller, subjects performed a variable speed walk test, a steady state walk test, and a 10-meter walk test. A GAITRite mat was used to collect spatial and temporal walking parameters during the 10-meter walk test. Results showed that subjects could control prosthetic knee swing duration and kinematics by modifying their walking speed. Subjects were able to comfortably transition between speeds and achieve mean (SD) comfortable and fast speeds of 1.10 (0.05) and 1.51 (0.05) m\/s, respectively for a 10-meter walk test.  contribution is to show that a variable speed knee controller can be combined with an impedance-based controller while maintaining the functionality of both controllers and to provide gait mechanics for amputee powered gait that can be used towards future studies of controller development and prosthesis design.  individuals with unilateral  I.

Changes in PB are often assumed as a consequence of fatigue, but effects of interventions that aim to reduce fatigue by improving PB are not sufficient. Since the heterogeneous nature of MS related symptoms, levels of PB of fatigued patients at the start of interventions might vary substantially. Better understanding of the variability by identification of PB subtypes in fatigued patients may help to develop more effective personalized rehabilitation programs in the future. This study aimed to identify PB subtypes in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis based on multidimensional PB outcome measures. Methods: Baseline accelerometer (Actigraph) data, demographics and clinical characteristics of the TREFAMS-ACE participants (n = 212) were used for secondary analysis. All patients were ambulatory and diagnosed with severe fatigue based on a score of ≥35 on the fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20r). Fifteen PB measures were used derived from 7 day measurements with an accelerometer. Principal component analysis was performed to define key outcome measures for PB and two-step cluster analysis was used to identify PB types. Results: Analysis revealed five key outcome measures: percentage sedentary behavior, total time in prolonged moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, number of sedentary bouts, and two types of change scores between day parts (morning, afternoon and evening). Based on these outcomes three valid PB clusters were derived. Conclusions: Patients with severe MS-related fatigue show three distinct and homogeneous PB subtypes. These PB subtypes, based on a unique set of PB outcome measures, may offer an opportunity to design more individually-tailored interventions in rehabilitation.

Gait simulation results are presented that indicate the majority of load bearing and the majority of power for gait is provided by the legs (i.e., quadriceps muscle stimulation). Based on these simulations, experiments on healthy subjects indicate that the gait restoration approach should be capable of providing long periods of locomotion unimpeded by quadriceps muscle fatigue. I. INTRODUCTION REVIOUS studies have demonstrated that functional electrical stimulation (FES) can be used for restoring gait to people with spinal cord injuries (SCI). Standing and walking can provide significant physiological and psychological benefits to those with SCI [1-9]. However, electrically stimulated muscles suffer from rapid fatigue [10], relatively poor controllability of stimulated muscles, and the inability to control degrees-of-freedom outside the sagittal plane. Hybrid systems, which combine FES with an orthosis, can address several of the shortcomings of FES-aided gait. Use of an orthosis reduces the duty cycle of muscle stimulation during stance, reduce the complexity of gait by imposing kinematic constraints, and enables closed-loop control of electrically stimulated muscle by providing a mounting platform for joint angle sensors. Recent research in hybrid FES gait restoration systems using surface and implanted electrodes include [11-15] and [16-18], respectively. This paper assesses the feasibility of a hybrid FES system that is different from others previously reported ([11-18]). The approach uses modulated brakes at the hip and knee joints (like [11-15]), unidirectional joint coupling between knee and hip flexion, and a biasing spring that biases the knee joint, and via coupling the hip joint, toward a flexed position. The device is called the Joint Couple Orthosis (JCO). Due to the joint coupling and biasing, a swing-through gait can be generated utilizing only surface stimulation of the quadriceps group of each leg (i.e., one stimulation channel per leg). The orthosis is an energetically passive device because all the power for gait comes from the user’s metabolic power supply, which enhances the physiological benefit for the user and also minimizes the battery requirements for the orthosis.

Working in awkward kneeling postures for prolonged time periods can lead to knee pain, injuries, and osteoarthritis. In this ar- ticle, we present lightweight, wearable sensing, and knee assistive devices for construction workers during kneel- ing and squatting tasks. Analysis of kneeling on level and sloped surfaces (0◦, 10◦, and 20◦) is performed for single- and double-leg kneeling tasks. Measurements from the in- tegrated inertial measurement units are used for real-time gait detection and lower limb pose estimation. Detected gait events and pose estimation are used to control the assis- tive knee joint torque provided by lightweight exoskeletons with powerful quasi-direct drive actuation. Human subject experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analysis and control design. The results show reduction in knee extension\/ﬂexion muscle activation (up to 39%) during stand-to-kneel and kneel-to-stand tasks.

With its two-layered unique structure, the frame is flexible in certain locations and directions, and stiff at certain other locations, so that it can fit well to the wearer’s thigh and transmit the assisting torque without joint loading. The paper describes the basic mechanics of this 3D flexible frame and its stiffness characteristics. We implemented the 3D flexible frame on a gait enhancing mechatronic system and conducted experiments. The performance of the proposed mechanism is verified by simulation and experiments. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, various types of exoskeletons have been developed to perform various tasks, ranging from lifting of heavy loads to aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals. Recently, efforts have been made to adapt them to the needs of public users such as elderly and infirm people. Using such a device to assist their walk or movements enables them to lead more active and independent lives. However, when compared with a device for the disabled who are completely dependent on an assistive device, the device for the general elderly and infirm people has to satisfy more stringent performance standards, such as higher assistive performance, better wearability, and lower product weight. In addition, the device should be able to provide a new user experience. Wearability and usability are the main issues with traditional exoskeleton mechanisms, which are usually composed of rigid frames with straps and are fitted at a certain location on the body [1-4]. With rigid frames, such a mechanism can support its own weight, and additional loads such as the weight of the wearer and the objects carried by him\/her. It can transmit the assisting torque from the actuator to the wearer’s body. On the other hand, its structure cannot be tightly fitted to the wearer’s lower body because of the rigid frames. It is too heavy and bulky, resulting in the high energy cost. Moreover, it also affects the natural gait dynamics and kinematics of the user. As an alternative to rigid exoskeletons, active soft orthotic systems [5-7] which can be tightly fitted to the wearer’s body have been developed. As compared to the traditional exoskeletons, these systems provide minimal mechanical impedance and kinematic restrictions.

The exosuit combines textile garments with cable driven actuators and is lighter and more compliant as compared to traditional rigid exoskeletons. By avoiding the use of rigid elements, exosuits offer greater comfort, facilitate donning\/doffing, and do not impose kinematic restrictions on the wearer – all while retaining the ability to generate significant moments at target joints during walking. The stroke-specific exosuit adapted from previous exosuit designs provides unilateral assistance to the paretic limb during walking. This paper describes stroke- specific design considerations, the design of the textile components, the development of a research-focused, mobile off-board actuation unit capable of testing the exosuit in a variety of walking conditions, a real-time gait detection and control algorithm, and proof-of-principle data validating the use of the exosuit in the chronic stroke population. Ultimately, we demonstrate reliable tracking of poststroke gait, appropriate timing of assistive forces, and improvements in key gait metrics. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of exosuits for poststroke gait assistance and training. Future work will involve the creation of a portable, body-worn system based on the specifications obtained from such feasibility studies that will enable community-based rehabilitation.","id":"8c79421f-2f61-4f21-a86c-5af86fe0afbd"}

Rouse, and Robert D. Gregg  Abstract—Most impedance-based walking controllers for pow- ered knee-ankle prostheses use a ﬁnite state machine with dozens of user-speciﬁc parameters that require manual tuning by technical experts. These parameters are only appropriate near the task (e.g., walking speed and incline) at which they were tuned, necessitating many different parameter sets for variable-task walking. In contrast, this paper presents a data- driven, phase-based controller for variable-task walking that uses continuously-variable impedance control during stance and kinematic control during swing to enable biomimetic locomotion. After generating a data-driven model of variable joint impedance with convex optimization, we implement a novel task-invariant phase variable and real-time estimates of speed and incline to enable autonomous task adaptation. Experiments with above- knee amputee participants (N=2) show that our data-driven controller 1) features highly-linear phase estimates and accurate task estimates, 2) produces biomimetic kinematic and kinetic trends as task varies, leading to low errors relative to able-bodied references, and 3) produces biomimetic joint work and cadence trends as task varies. We show that the presented controller meets and often exceeds the performance of a benchmark ﬁnite state machine controller for our two participants, without requiring manual impedance tuning.

It is considered one of the most widely spread exercises for muscle sport training and is part of the competition movements comprised within olympic weight-lifting. In physical rehabilitation, squats are used for muscular recovery after different injuries of the lower limbs, especially the knee. In previous anterior cruciate ligament injuries, the mini- squats are generally used, in a knee flexion motion range from 0º to 50º because in this range the shear forces, the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral compression forces decrease related to greater flexion angles. The aim of this work is to make a comparative bidimensional study of the kinematic and dynamic variables of the excecution of the parallel squat exercise with the front and back bar. It is observed in the knee a better development of energy with the front bar, allowing a better muscular exercise with the same load. The mean power absorbed by the hip with the back bar is considerably greater, associated to the speed of the gesture.  1. Introduction","id":"f439f4af-c1b6-4231-8000-cba4de999567"}

Quintero, Member, IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes a powered lower-limb orthosis that is intended to provide gait assistance to spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals by providing assistive torques at both hip and knee joints. The orthosis has a mass of 12 kg and is capable of providing maximum joint torques of 40 Nm with hip and knee joint ranges of motion from 105 ﬂexion to 30 extension and 105 ﬂexion to 10 hyperextension, respectively. A custom distributed embedded system controls the orthosis with power being provided by a lithium polymer battery which provides power for one hour of continuous walking. In order to demonstrate the ability of the orthosis to assist walking, the orthosis was experimentally imple- mented on a paraplegic subject with a T10 complete injury. Data collected during walking indicates a high degree of step-to-step re- peatabilityofhipandkneetrajectories(asenforcedbytheorthosis) and an average walking speed of 0.8 km\/hr. The electrical power required at each hip and knee joint during gait was approximately 25 and 27 W, respectively, contributing to the 117 W overall elec- trical power required by the device during walking.

A laboratory study was undertaken to determine the effect of 3 regular lifting techniques on erector muscle activation, cardio- vascular strain and subjective response. Thirty student volunteers participated in the study, and were re- quired to lift a weight with different techniques. Stoop-, squat-, semi-squat-lifting resulted in 3, 2 and 1 time of the highest percentage of the maximum voluntary electrical activation (MVE%) respectively. In the same order, the lowest median frequency (MF) existed 1, 1 and 2 times. Muscle fatigue was 4 times in squat, 36 in semi-squat and 43 in stoop lifting. Heart rate was the highest in squat and lowest in stoop respectively, with a middle level in semi-squat lifting. It may be recommended to adopt mainly the semi-squat technique for daily lifting works. For heavy lifting, it should use the squat technique. Stoop lifting may also be used alternatively but for light things.

In this paper, we propose a multi-level real-time on-board system to recognize continu- ous locomotion modes. A cascaded classiﬁcation strategy is designed for the recognition of six steady locomotion modes and 10 transitions. On-board signals of the robotic prosthesis include two inertial measurement units and one load cell. Three transtibial amputees are recruited in the experiments. The prediction decision time of the real-time on-board cascaded classiﬁcation system is about 3.3 ms, which is enough short compared with the sliding window increment 10 ms. It is easy to recognize the standing and ambulation in the ﬁrst-level classiﬁcation with a 99.86% accuracy by quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classi- ﬁer. In the second-level classiﬁcation, threshold method is adopted to divide one stride into swing and stance phases. In swing phase, ﬁve steady modes are recognized with a total accuracy of 96.40%. In stance phase, all these ﬁve steady modes are recognized with a total accuracy of 91.21%. The average recognition accuracy of the three sub- jects is 93.21% by QDA classiﬁer.

Through theoretical analysis with our simpliﬁed system model, we found that the optimal passive stiffness matches the slope of the desired torque-angle relationship. We also conjectured that a bandwidth limit resulted in a maximum rate of change in torque error that can be commanded through control input, which is ﬁxed across desired and passive stiffness conditions. This led to hypotheses about the interactions among optimal control gains, passive stiffness and desired quasi- stiffness. Walking experiments were conducted with multiple angle-based desired torque curves. The observed lowest torque tracking errors identiﬁed for each combination of desired and passive stiffnesses were shown to be linearly proportional to the magnitude of the difference between the two stiffnesses. The proportional gains corresponding to the lowest observed errors were seen inversely proportional to passive stiffness values and to desired stiffness. These ﬁndings supported our hypotheses, and provide guidance to application-speciﬁc hardware customization as well as controller design for torque-controlled robotic legged locomotion.","id":"2157db61-aa36-4656-875c-8bd68f884056"}

Gregg, Tommaso Lenzi, Nicholas P. Fey, Levi J. Hargrove, and Jonathon W. Sensinger  Abstract—This paper presents the design and experimental feedback control strategy that implementation of a novel regulates effective shape on a powered transfemoral prosthesis. The human effective shape is the effective geometry to which the biological leg conforms—through movement of ground reaction forces and leg joints—during the stance period of gait. Able- bodied humans regulate effective shapes to be invariant across conditions such as heel height, walking speed, and body weight, so this measure has proven to be a very useful tool for the alignment and design of passive prostheses. However, leg joints must be actively controlled to assume different effective shapes that are unique to tasks such as standing, walking, and stair climbing. Using our previous simulation studies as a starting point, we model and control the effective shape as a virtual kinematic constraint on the powered Vanderbilt prosthetic leg with a custom instrumented foot. An able-bodied subject used a by-pass adapter to walk on the controlled leg over ground and over a treadmill. These preliminary experiments demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, that effective shape (or virtual constraints in general) can be used to control a powered prosthetic leg.  I. INTRODUCTION  The effective shape of the human leg during locomotor tasks (called the rollover shape during walking) has been studied for over a decade [1] and has proven to be a very useful measure for gait analysis and prosthesis alignment [2], [3]. The effective shape is the trajectory of the center of pressure (COP)—the point on the plantar sole of the foot where the cumulative reaction force is imparted against the ground—mapped into a moving reference frame attached to the stance leg. For a rigid object, e.g., a metal wheel, the effective shape is its actual geometry. However, the effective shape of an object that includes a compliant or controllable joint—such as a human or prosthetic ankle—is variable and can be regulated, for example, within the local coordinate frame of the shank or thigh.  Able-bodied humans appear to regulate their effective shape to remain invariant across many conditions, including [3], walking speed [4], and body weight heel height [1]. This suggests the effective shape is fundamental to human locomotor control and could be useful for designing prosthetic legs that are more adaptable than conventional","id":"4df13113-0768-493c-b34c-798af6ebab7d"}

Lower-limb exoskeletons have potential to aid mobility, yet few studies have investigated their use during over-ground walking–anexercisethatmaycontributetoour understand- ingofpotentialbeneﬁtinfree-livingsettings.Thegoalofthis study was to determine the potential for adaptive plantar- ﬂexor assistance from an untethered ankle exoskeleton to improve over-ground walking economy and speed.

During a ﬁnal assessment visit, metabolic cost, walking speed, and soleus electromyography were collected for baseline, unpowered, low, training-tuned, and high assistanceconditions. Compared to each participant’s baseline condition, we observed a 3.9 ± 1.9% (p = 0.050) increase in walking speed and a 22.0 ± 4.5% (p = 0.002) reduction in soleus activity with training-tuned assistance; metaboliccostoftransportwasunchanged(p=0.130).High assistance resulted in an 8.5 ± 4.0% (p = 0.042) reduction in metabolic cost of transport, a 6.3 ± 2.6% (p = 0.029) increase in walking speed, and a 25.0 ± 4.0% (p < 0.001) reduction in soleus activity.

Huang* and Arthur D. Kuo  to greater metabolic energy expenditure. This underscores the need for a mechanistic explanation for the metabolic cost of walking as a function of load.  ABSTRACT Although humans clearly expend more energy to walk with an extra load, it is unclear what biomechanical mechanisms contribute to that increase. One possible contribution is the mechanical work performed on the body center of mass (COM), which simple models predict should increase linearly with added mass. The work should be performed primarily by the lower extremity joints, although in unknown distribution, and cost a proportionate amount of metabolic energy. We therefore tested normal adults (N=8) walking at constant speed (1.25 m s−1) with varying backpack loads up to 40% of body weight. We measured mechanical work (both performed on the COM and joint work from inverse dynamics), as well as metabolic energy expenditure through respirometry. Both measures of work were found to increase approximately linearly with carried load, with COM work rate increasing by approximately 1.40 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The joints all contributed work, but the greatest increase in positive work was attributable to the ankle during push-off (45–60% of stride time) and the knee in the rebound after collision (12–30% stride). The hip performed increasing amounts of negative work, near the end of stance. Rate of metabolic energy expenditure also increased approximately linearly with load, by approximately 7.6 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The ratio of the increases in work and metabolic cost yielded a relatively constant efficiency of approximately 16%. The metabolic cost not explained by work appeared to be relatively constant with load and did not exhibit a particular trend. Most of the increasing cost for carrying a load appears to be explained by positive mechanical work, especially about the ankle and knee, with both work and metabolic cost increasing nearly linearly with added mass.","id":"6c4cdecc-424a-46d3-97c8-949e0fbbaac1"}

However, gait performance is influenced by both human control and intelligent prosthesis control. Hence, we need to consider both human and prosthesis control, and their cooperation, to achieve desired gait patterns. In this study, we devel‑ oped a novel paradigm that engages human gait control via user‑fed visual feedback (FB) of stance time to cooperate with automatic prosthesis control tuning. Three initial questions were studied: (1) does user control of gait timing (via visual FB) help the prosthesis tuning algorithm to converge faster? (2) in turn, does the prosthesis control influence the user’s ability to reach and maintain the target stance time defined by the feedback? and (3) does the prosthesis control parameters tuned with extended stance time on prosthesis side allow the user to maintain this potentially beneficial behavior even after feedback is removed (short‑ and long‑term retention)?  Methods: A reinforcement learning algorithm was used to achieve prosthesis control to meet normative knee kinematics in walking. A visual FB system cued the user to control prosthesis‑side stance time to facilitate the pros‑ thesis tuning goal. Seven individuals without amputation (AB) and four individuals with transfemoral amputation (TFA) walked with a powered knee prosthesis on a treadmill. Participants completed prosthesis auto‑tuning with three visual feedback conditions: no FB, self‑selected stance time FB (SS FB), and increased stance time FB (Inc FB). The retention of FB effects was studied by comparing the gait performance across three different prosthesis controls, tuned with different visual FB.","id":"6d3f5c45-8a0d-4501-8eea-c71a4d4544f9"}

To over- come the poor wearability and assistive performance of conventional wearable walking assistance devices, three novel mechanisms are proposed: ﬁrst, a dual reduction actuator, which makes the mechanism more compact with minimal resistance, second, compliant joints, which adapt to human motion regardless of the wearing state, wearing position, and three-dimensional human joint motions, and third, a ﬂexible foot\/ankle mechanism, which helps in rigidly transmitting the assisting force only to the forefoot.

However, if the target group is extended to the geriatric popu- lation with moderate impairments, and the place of use extends to the home rather than to the hospital, the following additional requirements should be considered.

The SA knee relies on passive stability to provide support during the stance phase of walking and incorporates a small motor and battery to actively assist the knee motion during the swing phase. A prototype SA knee was constructed and experimentally evaluated on a single transfemoral amputee. The experiments consisted of treadmill walking at three speeds, first on a daily-use passive prosthesis and subsequently on the SA prosthesis prototype, while recording motion capture and ground reaction force data from which prosthesis knee kinematics and affected-side hip torque were computed. A comparison of the passive daily-use prosthesis and the SA prosthesis indicates that the SA prosthesis provides more consistent and repeatable knee motion and reduces pre-swing peak hip torque across all walking speeds. I. INTRODUCTION There are approximately 600,000 persons living in the US with major lower limb amputation, approximately half of whom have transfemoral amputation (TFA) [1]. The worldwide prevalence of TFA is approximately 20-30 times the US prevalence [2]. Multiple types of knee prostheses exist to help restore legged mobility to individuals with TFA [3]. The two primary functions of a knee prosthesis are to provide support (called stance control) during the stance phase of walking and to provide appropriate motion during the swing phase. Traditional passive prostheses typically provide stance phase stability via a hyperextension stop which is engaged by a combination of hip torque and ground reaction force. In some passive prostheses, knee stability during stance is further supplemented by the introduction of stance phase damping, either engaged by microprocessor control (e.g., C-leg) or by mechanical sensing of stance phase (e.g., Mauch knee). The essential aspects of swing phase are sufficient knee flexion to assure toe clearance (i.e., to avoid scuffing the ground during swing) and subsequent sufficient knee extension, which is necessary to achieve knee stability for the following stance phase. Passive knee prostheses achieve swing-phase motion by providing a low resistance which, when combined with the (active) swing phase movement of the residual thigh, in combination with the inertial properties of the lower leg, results in an initial swing-phase knee flexion, followed by knee extension. In some microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs), swing knee resistance is modulated as a function of walking cadence.

Herrin ,  Abstract—Genu recurvatum, or knee hyperextension, is a complex gait pattern with a variety of etiologies, and is often connected with knee weakness, lack of motor control, and spasticity. Because of the atypical forces placed on the soft tissues, early treatment or prevention of knee hyperex- tension may help prevent further degradation of the knee joint. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of a knee exoskeleton to mitigate hyperextension and increase swing range of motion in ﬁve children\/adolescents who presented with unilateral genu recurvatum. Over the course of three visits, each participant practiced walking with the exoskele- ton, which provided torque assistance during both stance and swing based on an impedance control law. In ﬁnal vali- dation trials, the exoskeleton was effective in reducing knee hyperextension (0.2 ± 4.7° average peak knee extension without exo to 9.9 ± 10.3° with exo) and improving swing range of motion by 14.0 ± 4.5° increase on average. How- ever, while the exoskeleton was effective in normalizing the kinematics, it did not lead to improved spatio-temporal asymmetry measures. This work showcases a promising potential application of a robotic knee exoskeleton for im- proving the kinematic characteristics of genu recurvatum gait.

In response to this opportunity, recent work on human-in-the-loop optimization has considered the problem of automatically tuning control parameters based on realtime physiological measurements. However, the common use of metabolic cost as a performance metric cre- ates significant experimental challenges due to its long measurement times and low signal- to-noise ratio. We evaluate the use of Bayesian optimization—a family of sample-efficient, noise-tolerant, and global optimization methods—for quickly identifying near-optimal control parameters. To manage experimental complexity and provide comparisons against related work, we consider the task of minimizing metabolic cost by optimizing walking step frequen- cies in unaided human subjects. Compared to an existing approach based on gradient descent, Bayesian optimization identified a near-optimal step frequency with a faster time to convergence (12 minutes, p < 0.01), smaller inter-subject variability in convergence time (± 2 minutes, p < 0.01), and lower overall energy expenditure (p < 0.01).","id":"83c48c6d-c03a-4873-9a50-7abe971973c0"}

Lerner  1,2, Diane L. Damiano1 & Thomas C. Bulea 1  Individuals with cerebral palsy often exhibit crouch gait, a debilitating and inefficient walking pattern marked by excessive knee flexion that worsens with age. To address the need for improved treatment, we sought to evaluate if providing external knee extension assistance could reduce the excessive burden placed on the knee extensor muscles as measured by knee moments. We evaluated a novel pediatric exoskeleton designed to provide appropriately-timed extensor torque to the knee joint during walking in a multi-week exploratory clinical study. Seven individuals (5–19 years) with mild-moderate crouch gait from cerebral palsy (GMFCS I-II) completed the study. For six participants, powered knee extension assistance favorably reduced the excessive stance-phase knee extensor moment present during crouch gait by a mean of 35% in early stance and 76% in late stance. Peak stance-phase knee and hip extension increased by 12° and 8°, respectively. Knee extensor muscle activity decreased slightly during exoskeleton-assisted walking compared to baseline, while knee flexor activity was elevated in some participants. These findings support the use of wearable exoskeletons for the management of crouch gait and provide insights into their future implementation.  Many individuals with cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent cause of physical disability in childhood1, present an increasingly flexed or “crouched” gait pattern throughout the lifespan2. This pathological gait pattern, known as crouch gait, increases the metabolic cost of transport3 and is associated with knee pain and degradation due to elevated joint loads4. Despite efforts to manage crouch gait surgically5,6 and with physical therapy7, walking defi- cits generally remain after treatment such that approximately 50% of affected individuals lose the ability to walk independently in adulthood8. Effective gait rehabilitation remains a major clinical challenge in CP9.","id":"c3c0cfb2-602f-4a4b-8908-b8b2c7ba9daa"}

Over-ground leg ex- oskeletons commonly use traditional rigid link architectures or support the weight of a user by strapping the user in a harness. This results in bulky and large architectures which are cumbersome and restrictive. C-ALEX is a leg exoskeleton without a rigid link structure which has been used in gait training on a treadmill. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using the C-ALEX exoskeleton over-ground. We converted C-ALEX into a carted system for over-ground use. We tested the architecture on eight healthy subjects to compare the controller’s RMS joint torque errors, the effects on step height, joint angles and the deviation of ankle trajectories from target trajectories. The results show that C-ALEX’s controller and tension planner have comparable RMS torque errors with no signiﬁcant difference between the two use cases. C-ALEX is able to increase the step height, affect knee ﬂexion in both walking conditions with no signiﬁcant difference. There is signiﬁcant difference between C-ALEX’s ability to control hip ﬂexion angles and deviation area over-ground and on a treadmill.  I. INTRODUCTION  on the range of motion and degrees-of-freedom of users are present in such architectures. In summary, the current over-ground gait training technologies is severely limited. There is a need to move robotic devices off the treadmill to address the inherent differences in over-ground and on treadmill biomechanics, as well as to assess the differences between training on treadmill and over-ground [11].","id":"82f9ef47-b358-49f4-9752-5d1487aba0ba"}

We investigated whether motion assistance from HAL during squat exercise could effectively reduce the cardiopulmonary burden in healthy subjects. Twelve healthy subjects (33 ± 11 years) performed squat exercise for 3 consecutive minutes at a repetition rate of 20 squats per minute with and without assistance from a lumbar-type HAL. The oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide output (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), and the Borg Scale were monitored during exercise. VO2 (930 ± 207 vs 992 ± 169 mL\/min, p < 0.05) and the Borg Scale rating (12.8 ± 1.1 vs 13.7 ± 0.8, p < 0.05) at the end of exercise were signiﬁcantly lower when HAL was used. When 2 subjects who regularly perform high-intensity exercise for more than 10 h per week were excluded from the analyses, VO2, VCO2, VE, and the Borg Scale were signiﬁcantly lower when HAL was used. Our results demonstrate that the lumbar-type HAL signiﬁcantly reduces cardiopulmonary burden during squat exercise in healthy subjects. The effects were especially striking in sedentary sub- jects. Further studies on cardiac patients are expected to establish a new cardiac rehabilitation program using HAL.","id":"a29715a8-d635-4cf3-a447-38917d63d47e"}

Speciﬁcally, the accuracy and eﬃciency can be balanced well by BLS. However, the presence of outliers in data may destroy the stability and generality of standard BLS. In this paper, we propose the robust version of BL S (RBL S) to treat the data modeling with outliers. By assuming the regression residual and output weights follow their respective distributions, the objective function for RBLS is derived and the output weights for robust modeling can be determined by maximum a posterior estimation. Then the robustness of RBLS can be enhanced further by integrating the regularization theory. The Augmented Lagrange Multiplier method is utilized to optimize the novel models eﬃciently, and a solid theoretical proof is given to guarantee that the proposed RBLS is more robust than the standard BLS. Extensive ex- periments on function approximation and real-world regression are carried out to demonstrate that our proposed RBLS model can achieve a better modeling performance in uncertain data environment than the standard BLS and other regression algorithms.  © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Walsh 电缆驱动外骨骼 骨盆运动调节 动态步态支持","content":"Abstract— This paper presents a modular, computationally-distributed “multi-robot” cyberphysical system designed to assist children with developmental delays in learning to walk. The system consists of two modules, each assisting a different aspect of gait: a tethered cable pelvic module with up to 6 degrees of freedom (DOF), which can modulate the motion of the pelvis in three dimensions, and a two DOF wearable hip module assisting lower limb motion, specifically hip flexion. Both modules are designed to be lightweight and minimally restrictive to the user, and the modules can operate independently or in cooperation with each other, allowing flexible system configuration to provide highly customized and adaptable assistance. Motion tracking performance of approximately 2 mm root mean square (RMS) error for the pelvic module and less than 0.1 mm RMS error for the hip module was achieved. We demonstrate coordinated operation of the two modules on a mannequin test platform with articulated and instrumented lower limbs. I. INTRODUCTION Developmental delay due to premature birth is a major public health problem in the United States [1]. One and a half percent of the more than 4.25 million infants born annually in the U.S. have a very low birth weight [2], and of the 90% that survive, 25-50% suffer a brain injury resulting in development of locomotor delays [3]–[5]. Cerebral palsy (CP) is one manifestation of these locomotor delays and the most common childhood disability that causes lifelong physical impairment, affecting an average of 3.1 per 1000 children in the US [6]. As fundamental motor skills are typically acquired in the early stages of development [7], early intervention is critical, and may help prevent or mitigate development of abnormal movement patterns that lead to secondary musculoskeletal *This research is supported by NSF grant 1329363, by the Harvard John A.

Although machine vision has recently proven to be a promising tool in identifying upcoming terrains in the travel path, existing approaches are limited to environment perception rather than human intent recognition that is essential for coordinated wearable robot operation. Hence, in this study, we aim to develop a novel system that fuses the human gaze (representing user intent) and machine vision (capturing environmental information) for accurate prediction of the user’s locomotion mode. The system pos- sessesmultimodalvisualinformationandrecognizesuser’s locomotion intent in a complex scene, where multiple ter- rains are present. Additionally, based on the dynamic time warping algorithm, a fusion strategy was developed to align temporal predictions from individual modalities while pro- ducing ﬂexible decisions on the timing of locomotion mode transition for wearable robot control. System performance was validated using experimental data collected from ﬁve participants, showing high accuracy (over 96% in average) of intent recognition and reliable decision-making on loco- motion transition with adjustable lead time. The promising results demonstrate the potential of fusing human gaze and machine vision for locomotion intent recognition of lower limb wearable robots.

INTRODUCTION Observe gait is clinically important to allow physical therapists (PT) and clinicians to assess motor deficits in patients. However, the inconsistent results in the skill of visual assessment lead to a question about whether clinicians are accurate and reliable on gait judgment[1, 2]. Also, little is known about which gait features would base accurate judgments. The purpose of this study is to investigate (1) the differences in observational gait analysis skill between those with different level of clinical experience and (2) the kinematics features informative for perceiving amputee gait. We introduced a new method that combines biological motion and principal component analysis (PCA) to gradually mesh amputee and typical walking patterns for raters to rank. The synthesized patterns preserved the kinematics features that allow physical therapists (PT), PT students (PTS), and novice raters to discriminate different levels of gait impairment. This method can be used to train and evaluate observational gait analysis of PTs, physicians, and prosthetists. In addition, the identified gait features that PTs attended to might inform the future design of automated, clinically relevant gait evaluation and automatic prosthesis tuning algorithm in the future.

Cable-driven exoskeletons eliminate the rigid-linked skele- ton, providing a lighter and transparent design. Current cable-drivenexoskeletonsare aimed only at gait assistance byprovidingshort burstsof forcesto the legduringwalking. It has not yet been shown if these designs are suitable for gait retraining, where rehabilitative forces need to be continuously applied to the leg in response to errors from a desired movement. The goal of this study is to investi- gate if a cable-driven leg exoskeleton can retrain the gait of human users. Nine healthy subjects were trained by a cable-driven leg exoskeleton to walk in a new gait pattern with 30% increase in step height from their natural gait. After 40 min of training, the gait of the subjects became signiﬁcantlycloserto thetargetgaitthanbeforethetraining. In three different post-training sessions, the step height of the subjects increased by 22%, 29%, and 31% on an average.Inafourthpost-trainingsession,whenthesubjects were instructed to ignore the training and walk naturally, the step height remained increased by 11%.

In response to this opportunity, recent work on human-in-the-loop optimization has considered the problem of automatically tuning control parameters based on realtime physiological measurements. However, the common use of metabolic cost as a performance metric cre- ates significant experimental challenges due to its long measurement times and low signal- to-noise ratio. We evaluate the use of Bayesian optimization—a family of sample-efficient, noise-tolerant, and global optimization methods—for quickly identifying near-optimal control parameters. To manage experimental complexity and provide comparisons against related work, we consider the task of minimizing metabolic cost by optimizing walking step frequen- cies in unaided human subjects. Compared to an existing approach based on gradient descent, Bayesian optimization identified a near-optimal step frequency with a faster time to convergence (12 minutes, p < 0.01), smaller inter-subject variability in convergence time (± 2 minutes, p < 0.01), and lower overall energy expenditure (p < 0.01).","id":"83c48c6d-c03a-4873-9a50-7abe971973c0"}

Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Compared to rigid actuators, Series Elastic Ac- tuators (SEAs) offer a potential reduction of motor energy consumption and peak power, though these beneﬁts are highly dependent on the design of the torque-elongation proﬁle of the elastic element. In the case of linear springs, natural dynamics is a traditional method for this design, but it has two major limitations: arbitrary load trajectories are difﬁcult or impossible to analyze and it does not consider actuator constraints. Paramet- ric optimization is also a popular design method that addresses these limitations, but solutions are only optimal within the space of the parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-parametric convex optimization program for the design of the nonlinear elastic element that minimizes energy consumption and peak power for an arbitrary periodic reference trajectory. To obtain convexity, we introduce a convex approximation to the expression of peak power; energy consumption is shown to be convex without approximation. The combination of peak power and energy consumption in the cost function leads to a multiobjective convex optimization framework that comprises the main contribution of this paper. As a case study, we recover the elongation-torque proﬁle of a cubic spring, given its natural oscillation as the reference load. We then design nonlinear SEAs for an ankle prosthesis that minimize energy consumption and peak power for different trajectories and extend the range of achievable tasks when subject to actuator constraints.

Gregg , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Goal: Accounting for gait individuality is im- portant to positive outcomes with wearable robots, but manually tuning multi-activity models is time-consuming and not viable in a clinic. Generalizations can possibly be made to predict gait individuality in unobserved conditions. Methods: Kinematic individuality—how one person’s joint angles differ from the group—is quantiﬁed for every sub- ject, joint, ambulation mode (walking, running, stair ascent, and stair descent), and intramodal task (speed, incline) in an open-access dataset with 10 able-bodied subjects. Four N-way ANOVAs test how prediction methods affect the ﬁt to experimental data between and within ambulation modes. We test whether walking individuality (measured at a single speed on level ground) carries across modes, or whether a mode-speciﬁc prediction (based on a single task for each mode) is signiﬁcantly more effective. Results: Kinematic individualization improves ﬁt across joint and task if we consider each mode separately. Across all modes, tasks, and joints, modal individualization improved the ﬁt in 81% of trials, improving the ﬁt on average by 4.3◦ across the gait cycle. This was statistically signiﬁcant at all joints for walk- ing and running, and half the joints for stair ascent\/descent. Conclusions: For walking and running, kinematic individu- ality can be easily generalized within mode, but the trends are mixed on stairs depending on joint.  Index Terms—Biomechanics, gait recognition, assistive  devices, assistive robots.  Impact Statement— Isolating what makes gait unique for a person during activities of daily living allows us to gen- eralize movement individuality, making assistive devices easier to implement.  I.

Although machine vision has recently proven to be a promising tool in identifying upcoming terrains in the travel path, existing approaches are limited to environment perception rather than human intent recognition that is essential for coordinated wearable robot operation. Hence, in this study, we aim to develop a novel system that fuses the human gaze (representing user intent) and machine vision (capturing environmental information) for accurate prediction of the user’s locomotion mode. The system pos- sessesmultimodalvisualinformationandrecognizesuser’s locomotion intent in a complex scene, where multiple ter- rains are present. Additionally, based on the dynamic time warping algorithm, a fusion strategy was developed to align temporal predictions from individual modalities while pro- ducing ﬂexible decisions on the timing of locomotion mode transition for wearable robot control. System performance was validated using experimental data collected from ﬁve participants, showing high accuracy (over 96% in average) of intent recognition and reliable decision-making on loco- motion transition with adjustable lead time. The promising results demonstrate the potential of fusing human gaze and machine vision for locomotion intent recognition of lower limb wearable robots.

A powered stairmill, integrated with a gait rehabilitation device, can potentially be used for training those who have difﬁculty climbing stairs. In order to assess the effec- tiveness of such an approach, it is necessary to understand the similarities and differences in walking on regular stairs and on a stairmill. We have conducted an experiment to compare the differences in kine- matics and muscle activations during climbing on regular stairs and a stairmill. Twelve subjects partic- ipated in this study. They ﬁrst walked on regular stairs ﬁve times and then performed a one-minute continuous walking on a stairmill. The results showed several important differences. During continuous walking on a stairmill, when compared to regular stairs, there was (i) an increase in the percentage of stance phase during a walking cycle, (ii) a higher angle of plantarﬂexion of the ankle during the transition from stance phase to swing phase, and (iii) a decrease in muscle activation of the tibialis anterior during swing phase. These differences would provide additional insights into the design of future rehabilitation systems and to interpret human data obtained from stairmills.   2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.  1.

Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009;90: 136-44.  Objectives: To test the hypothesis that reducing vertical center of mass (COM) displacement will lower the metabolic cost of human walking. To examine changes in joint work associated with increasing and decreasing vertical COM move- ment during gait.  Design: Randomized repeated measures. Setting: Human Neuromechanics Laboratory, University of  Michigan.  Participants: Able-bodied subjects (N10). Interventions: Subjects walked at 1.2m\/s on a treadmill and overground. Subjects manipulated vertical COM displacement either by adjusting stride length or by using visual feedback to reduce COM movement.  Main Outcome Measures: We measured kinematic and kinetic data to calculate vertical and lateral COM displace- ments, joint torques, and work. In addition, we collected oxy- gen consumption to calculated metabolic power.  Results: Increasing and decreasing vertical COM displace- ment beyond subjects’ preferred range resulted in increases in the metabolic cost of walking. When vertical COM displace- ment was reduced, corresponding increases in positive ankle and hip work and negative knee work were observed.  Conclusions: Humans are capable of walking in a manner that will reduce COM displacement from normal. Decreasing vertical COM movement results in increases in metabolic en- ergy costs because of greater mechanical work performed at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Thus, reducing vertical COM movement is not a successful strategy for improving either metabolic or mechanical energy economy during normal walk- ing by able-bodied subjects.","id":"dbf013c0-0eb4-46b3-9f71-1f84e0e5f252"}

Ishmael, Minh Tran, Student Member, IEEE, and Tommaso Lenzi, Member, IEEE    Abstract In this paper, we explore the effect of residual hip assistance in one above-knee amputee subject using a novel lightweight powered hip exoskeleton. Differently from a powered prosthesis, a powered hip exoskeleton adds mass proximally. Thus, we expect that the negative effect of the added mass will be lower for a powered hip exoskeleton than a powered ankle and knee prosthesis. Consequently, residual-hip assistance may more easily lead to a net reduction of metabolic effort. To preliminarily assess this hypothesis, we measured the physiological cost index (PCI) while an above-knee subject walked with and without a powered hip exoskeleton. Experimental results show 20.5% reduction of PCI when walking with the powered hip exoskeleton. I. INTRODUCTION  the performance and reduce the mass of powered prostheses.

Rouse, Gray Cortright Thomas  Abstract—While assistive exoskeletons typically focus on the metric of metabolic cost, we hypothesize that exoskeletons of sufﬁcient power density could also reduce knee joint loading, which is understood to be a risk factor for osteoarthritis. Using biomechanical locomotion data, we run a simple simulation of two types of exoskeletons: those that provide a parallel load-path to ground, and those that apply torque directly to the human knee joint. We ﬁnd that the second type offers larger reductions at normal walking speeds and that the power density required for knee load reduction is much lower than for metabolic cost reduction.

Shepherd , Member, IEEE, Sierra C. Mulrine , Julianne D. Schneider  ,  Kelly F. Moore, Erin M. Eggebrecht, Benjamin M. Rogozinski and Aaron J. Young , Member, IEEE  , Kinsey R. Herrin ,  Abstract—Genu recurvatum, or knee hyperextension, is a complex gait pattern with a variety of etiologies, and is often connected with knee weakness, lack of motor control, and spasticity. Because of the atypical forces placed on the soft tissues, early treatment or prevention of knee hyperex- tension may help prevent further degradation of the knee joint. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of a knee exoskeleton to mitigate hyperextension and increase swing range of motion in ﬁve children\/adolescents who presented with unilateral genu recurvatum. Over the course of three visits, each participant practiced walking with the exoskele- ton, which provided torque assistance during both stance and swing based on an impedance control law. In ﬁnal vali- dation trials, the exoskeleton was effective in reducing knee hyperextension (0.2 ± 4.7° average peak knee extension without exo to 9.9 ± 10.3° with exo) and improving swing range of motion by 14.0 ± 4.5° increase on average. How- ever, while the exoskeleton was effective in normalizing the kinematics, it did not lead to improved spatio-temporal asymmetry measures. This work showcases a promising potential application of a robotic knee exoskeleton for im- proving the kinematic characteristics of genu recurvatum gait.

Traditionally, collection of kinetics is mostly lim- ited to the lab environment because it relies on data that are measured from a motion capture system and ﬂoor- embedded force plates to calculate the dynamics via mus- culoskeletal models. This spatially limited method makes it extremely challenging to measure kinetics outside the laboratory in a variety of walking conditions due to the expensive device setup and large space required. Recently, employing machine learning with IMU sensors are sug- gested as an alternative method for biomechanical analy- ses. Although these methods enable estimating human ki- netic data outside the laboratory by linking IMU sensor data with kinetics dataset, they are limited to show inaccurate kinetic estimates even in highly repeatable single walking conditions due to the employment of generic deep learn- ing algorithms. Thus, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model, Kinetics-FM-DLR-Ensemble-Net for single limb prediction of hip, knee, and ankle joint moments and 3-dimensional GRFs using three IMU sensors on the thigh, shank, and foot under several representatives walking con- ditions in daily living, such as treadmill, level-ground, stair, and ramp. This is the ﬁrst study that implements both joint moments and GRFs in multiple walking conditions using IMU sensors via deep learning. Our deep learning model is versatile and accurate for identifying human kinetics across diverse subjects and walking conditions and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning model for kinetics estimation by a large margin.

A soft assistive ankle device, or exosuit, reduced metabolic cost by 10% compared to walking with the device applying no assistance in individuals with chronic stroke [2]. The device applied predefined active plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance on the paretic side.  A different unilateral ankle plantarflexion device, or exoskeleton, has been shown to decrease metabolic energy consumption by about 24% compared to walking with the device applying no assistance in able- bodied individuals with human-in-the-loop optimization [3], [4]. Human-in-the-loop optimization identifies user specific assistance strategies in real time based on biological measurements of the user.  Research Question  Does customized assistance significantly reduce the metabolic cost of walking in one participant with chronic stroke using our active plantarflexion exoskeleton with added passive dorsiflexion assistance?  Methods  One individual with hemiparesis (male, age 74, 38 months post-stroke) walked on a treadmill at a self- selected speed wearing an ankle exoskeleton on the paretic leg while the optimizer worked to find a customized assistance strategy. The optimizer relied on a genetic algorithm where the best assistance strategies from one generation inform the next generation of strategies to be sampled.  Device assistance was optimized over four days of walking. The participant completed four generations during the first two days. The participant was then further trained to more effectively use the device. Optimization was restarted, and three generations and a validation test were conducted over the last two days. Metabolic cost and ankle angle were collected. Ankle angle was approximated using an encoder located coaxially with the ankle joint.  Results","id":"4f708ab7-5e88-4771-afc3-3db6eeb753df"}

To improve the performance of BLDC motors, different control methods have been developed by many researchers. Those are such as the field weakening control method, overlapping method, PWM chopping method [3]-[6].  Abstract— The BLDC (Brushless DC) motor is characterized by linear torque to current and speed to voltage. It has low acoustic noise and fast dynamic response. Moreover, it has high power density with high proportion of torque to inertia in spite of small size drive. However, at high-speed operation, torque and speed response characteristic is deteriorated by the motor inductance components in stator windings. It is difficult that the BLDC motor is used to the industrial application requiring a wide range of operating speeds. Phase advance angle control method of different methods used to improve torque and speed response is used widely at high-speed operation. However, conventional phase advance angle control method was considered about forward motoring mode. Therefore, position information error of rotor that reverse motoring mode has phase lag angle of double is occurred. comparing with Consequently, torque performance is destroyed significantly. In this paper, a control method using adjustment of the phase advance angle is proposed. This proposed method improves the torque and speed response characteristic by minimizing delay of current at high-speed operation. Simulated results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparison with the conventional control method.","id":"48d2d09e-12a2-463b-aa98-d71fa131cb1e"}

The purpose of this article is to provide a new framework for human–robot interaction control of LLEs. First, we designed the generative adversar- ial network-based graph transformer (GANGT) for applica- tion under small sample surface electromyography (sEMG) dataset conditions. The adversarial learning is utilized to generate featured sEMG data, and graph structure-based temporal and spatial self-attention mechanisms are con- structed to capture the local and global features of the sEMG signal during a gait cycle. Second, we designed a robust following controller to control the tracking error of the predicted joint angles and proved its stability through the Lyapunov function. The controller is able to maintain the tracking error within a small bound in the case of un- modeled errors and external disturbances in the dynamical system of the exoskeleton. To validate the effectiveness of the control framework, we conducted a series of ex- periments with recruited subjects.

Lynch, Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—The ParkourBot climbs in a planar reduced-gravity vertical chute by leaping back and forth between the chute’s two parallel walls. The ParkourBot is comprised of a body with two springy legs and its controls consist of leg angles at touchdown and the energy stored in them. During ﬂight, the robot stores elastic potential energy in its springy legs and then converts this poten- tial energy in to kinetic energy at touchdown, when it “kicks off” a wall. This paper describes the ParkourBot’s mechanical design, modeling, and open-loop climbing experiments. The mechanical design makes use of the BowLeg, previously used for hopping on a ﬂat ground. We introduce two models of the BowLeg ParkourBot: one is based on a nonzero stance duration using the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, and the other is a simpliﬁed model (the simplest parkour model, or SPM) obtained as the leg stiffness ap- proaches inﬁnity and the stance time approaches zero. The SPM approximation provides the advantage of closed-form calculations.

Rouse1, Luke M. Mooney2 and Hugh M. Herr1,3  Abstract Currently, the mobility of above-knee amputees is limited by the lack of available prostheses that can efficiently replicate biologically accurate movements. In this study, a powered knee prosthesis was designed utilizing a novel mechanism, known as a clutchable series-elastic actuator (CSEA).The CSEA includes a low-power clutch in parallel with an electric motor within a traditional series-elastic actuator. The stiffness of the series elasticity was tuned to match the elastically conservative region of the knee’s torque-angle relationship during the stance phase of locomotion. During this region, the clutch was used to efficiently store energy in the series elasticity. The fully autonomous knee prosthesis design utilized a brushless electric motor, ballscrew transmission and cable drive, as well as commercial electrical components. The knee was lighter than the eighth percentile and shorter than the first percentile male shank segment. The CSEA Knee was tested in a unilateral above-knee amputee walking at 1.3 m\/s. During walking, the CSEA Knee provided biomechanically accurate torque-angle behavior, agreeing within 17% of the net work and 27% of the stance flexion angle produced by the biological knee. In addition, the process of locomotion reduced the net electrical energy consumption of the CSEA Knee. The knee’s motor generated 1.8 J\/stride, and the net energy consumption was 3.6 J\/stride, an order of magnitude less energy than previously published powered knee prostheses.

Nguyen1, Rachel W. Jackson2, Yashar Aucie3, Digna de Kam3, Steven H. Collins1 and Gelsy Torres-Oviedo3*  Abstract  Background: Asymmetric gait post-stroke is associated with decreased mobility, yet individuals with chronic stroke often self-select an asymmetric gait despite being capable of walking more symmetrically. The purpose of this study was to test whether self-selected asymmetry could be explained by energy cost minimization. We hypothesized that short-term deviations from self-selected asymmetry would result in increased metabolic energy consumption, despite being associated with long-term rehabilitation benefits. Other studies have found no difference in metabolic rate across different levels of enforced asymmetry among individuals with chronic stroke, but used methods that left some uncertainty to be resolved.  Methods: In this study, ten individuals with chronic stroke walked on a treadmill at participant-specific speeds while voluntarily altering step length asymmetry. We included only participants with clinically relevant self-selected asymmetry who were able to significantly alter asymmetry using visual biofeedback. Conditions included targeting zero asymmetry, self-selected asymmetry, and double the self-selected asymmetry. Participants were trained with the biofeedback system in one session, and data were collected in three subsequent sessions with repeated measures. Self-selected asymmetry was consistent across sessions. A similar protocol was conducted among unimpaired participants. Results: Participants with chronic stroke substantially altered step length asymmetry using biofeedback, but this did not affect metabolic rate (ANOVA, p = 0.68). In unimpaired participants, self-selected step length asymmetry was close to zero and corresponded to the lowest metabolic energy cost (ANOVA, p = 6e-4). While the symmetry of unimpaired gait may be the result of energy cost minimization, self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke cannot be explained by a similar least-effort drive.  Conclusions: Interventions that encourage changes in step length asymmetry by manipulating metabolic energy consumption may be effective because these therapies would not have to overcome a metabolic penalty for altering asymmetry.","id":"8736cf6b-b599-4ab7-8618-f7bb3def1f90"}

Here, we introduce a novel semi-active hip exoskeleton concept and evaluate human walking performance across a range of parameters using a tethered robotic testbed. Methods: We emulated semi-active hip exoskeleton (exo) assistance by applying a virtual torsional spring with a fixed rotational stiffness and an equilibrium angle established in terminal swing phase (i.e., via pre- tension into stance). We performed a 2-D sweep of spring stiffness x equilibrium position parameters (30 combinations) across walking speed (1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m\/s) and measured metabolic rate to identify device parameters for optimal metabolic benefit. Results: At each speed, optimal exoskeleton spring settings provided a ~10% metabolic benefit compared to zero-impedance (ZI). Higher walking speeds required higher exoskeleton stiffness and lower equilibrium angle for maximal metabolic benefit. Optimal parameters tuned to each individual (user-dependent) provided significantly larger metabolic benefit than the average- best settings (user-independent) at all speeds except the fastest (p = 0.021, p = 0.001, and p = 0.098 at 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m\/s, respectively). We found significant correlation between changes in user’s muscle activity and changes in metabolic rate due to exoskeleton assistance, especially for muscles crossing the hip joint. Conclusion: A semi-active hip exoskeleton with spring- parameters personalized to each user could provide metabolic benefit across functional walking speeds. Minimizing muscle activity local to the exoskeleton is a promising approach for tuning assistance on-line on a user-dependent basis.  exoskeletons  Index Terms—Exoskeleton, Hip, Muscle Electromyography, Impedance Control, Metabolic Cost, Walking Speed  I.

The SA knee relies on passive stability to provide support during the stance phase of walking and incorporates a small motor and battery to actively assist the knee motion during the swing phase. A prototype SA knee was constructed and experimentally evaluated on a single transfemoral amputee. The experiments consisted of treadmill walking at three speeds, first on a daily-use passive prosthesis and subsequently on the SA prosthesis prototype, while recording motion capture and ground reaction force data from which prosthesis knee kinematics and affected-side hip torque were computed. A comparison of the passive daily-use prosthesis and the SA prosthesis indicates that the SA prosthesis provides more consistent and repeatable knee motion and reduces pre-swing peak hip torque across all walking speeds. I. INTRODUCTION There are approximately 600,000 persons living in the US with major lower limb amputation, approximately half of whom have transfemoral amputation (TFA) [1]. The worldwide prevalence of TFA is approximately 20-30 times the US prevalence [2]. Multiple types of knee prostheses exist to help restore legged mobility to individuals with TFA [3]. The two primary functions of a knee prosthesis are to provide support (called stance control) during the stance phase of walking and to provide appropriate motion during the swing phase. Traditional passive prostheses typically provide stance phase stability via a hyperextension stop which is engaged by a combination of hip torque and ground reaction force. In some passive prostheses, knee stability during stance is further supplemented by the introduction of stance phase damping, either engaged by microprocessor control (e.g., C-leg) or by mechanical sensing of stance phase (e.g., Mauch knee). The essential aspects of swing phase are sufficient knee flexion to assure toe clearance (i.e., to avoid scuffing the ground during swing) and subsequent sufficient knee extension, which is necessary to achieve knee stability for the following stance phase. Passive knee prostheses achieve swing-phase motion by providing a low resistance which, when combined with the (active) swing phase movement of the residual thigh, in combination with the inertial properties of the lower leg, results in an initial swing-phase knee flexion, followed by knee extension. In some microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs), swing knee resistance is modulated as a function of walking cadence.

Farris, Member, IEEE, Hugo A. Quintero, Member, IEEE, Spencer A. Murray, Student Member, IEEE, Kevin H. Ha, Student Member, IEEE, Clare Hartigan, and Michael Goldfarb, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper presents an assessment of a lower limb exoskeleton for providing legged mobility to people with para- plegia. In particular, the paper presents a single-subject case study comparing legged locomotion using the exoskeleton to locomotion using knee–ankle–foot orthoses (KAFOs) on a subject with a T10 motor and sensory complete injury. The assessment utilizes three assessment instruments to characterize legged mobility, which are the timed up-and-go test, the Ten-Meter Walk Test (10 MWT), and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT), which collectively assess the subject’s ability to stand, walk, turn, and sit. The exertion associated with each assessment instrument was assessed using the Physiological Cost Index. Results indicate that the subject was able to perform the respective assessment instruments 25%, 70%, and 80% faster with the exoskeleton relative to the KAFOs for the timed up-and-go test, the 10 MWT, and the 6 MWT, respectively. Measurements of exertion indicate that the exoskeleton requires 1.6, 5.2, and 3.2 times less exertion than the KAFOs for each respective assessment instrument. The results indicate that the en- hancement in speed and reduction in exertion are more signiﬁcant during walking than during gait transitions.  entails signiﬁcant health consequences, including loss of bone mineral content, frequent skin breakdown problems, increased incidence of urinary tract infection, muscle spasticity, impaired lymphatic and vascular circulation, impaired digestive opera- tion, and reduced respiratory and cardiovascular capacities [2]. In an effort to restore legged locomotion to individuals with paraplegia, several computer-controlled lower limb orthoses have been, and are being, developed and described in the research literature. Such orthoses include hybrid functional electrical stimulation (FES)-systems, which supplement FES of leg muscles with a computer-controlled orthosis; and fully powered orthoses (or exoskeletons), which utilize electric mo- tors as the primary form of motive assistance. Recent examples of the former include those described in [3]–[7], while recent examples of the latter include those described in [8]–[16].  Index","id":"36d0ad3e-2305-46e5-bc09-ef5ea8d5c89a"}

A soft assistive ankle device, or exosuit, reduced metabolic cost by 10% compared to walking with the device applying no assistance in individuals with chronic stroke [2]. The device applied predefined active plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance on the paretic side.  A different unilateral ankle plantarflexion device, or exoskeleton, has been shown to decrease metabolic energy consumption by about 24% compared to walking with the device applying no assistance in able- bodied individuals with human-in-the-loop optimization [3], [4]. Human-in-the-loop optimization identifies user specific assistance strategies in real time based on biological measurements of the user.  Research Question  Does customized assistance significantly reduce the metabolic cost of walking in one participant with chronic stroke using our active plantarflexion exoskeleton with added passive dorsiflexion assistance?  Methods  One individual with hemiparesis (male, age 74, 38 months post-stroke) walked on a treadmill at a self- selected speed wearing an ankle exoskeleton on the paretic leg while the optimizer worked to find a customized assistance strategy. The optimizer relied on a genetic algorithm where the best assistance strategies from one generation inform the next generation of strategies to be sampled.  Device assistance was optimized over four days of walking. The participant completed four generations during the first two days. The participant was then further trained to more effectively use the device. Optimization was restarted, and three generations and a validation test were conducted over the last two days. Metabolic cost and ankle angle were collected. Ankle angle was approximated using an encoder located coaxially with the ankle joint.  Results","id":"4f708ab7-5e88-4771-afc3-3db6eeb753df"}

This would require a different design approach: Instead of assisting muscles in con- centricorisometriccontractions,deviceswould need to assist muscles in producing force dur- ing eccentric contractions. The strategy of removing energy is similar to those employed by some biomechanical energy harvesters op- timizedtoproduceelectricalpower(12–14).Unfortu- nately, these devices have not been able to provide their users with a metabolic benefit over carrying their own weight, let alone an advantage over normal walking [(12–14); also see supplementary materials]. Because the metabolic cost of walking can be explained pri- marily by the cost of actively generating mus- cle force (15), we hypothesized that we could optimize these devices for metabolic cost re- duction by designing them with the aim of de- creasing muscle activation instead of producing electrical power.  EXOSKELETONS  Removing energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking  Michael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*  Evolutionary pressures have led humans to walk in a highly efficient manner that conserves energy, making it difficult for exoskeletons to reduce the metabolic cost of walking. Despite the challenge, some exoskeletons have managed to lessen the metabolic expenditure of walking, either by adding or storing and returning energy. We show that the use of an exoskeleton that strategically removes kinetic energy during the swing period of the gait cycle reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 2.5 ± 0.8% for healthy male users while converting the removed energy into 0.25 ± 0.02 watts of electrical power. By comparing two loading profiles, we demonstrate that the timing and magnitude of energy removal are vital for successful metabolic cost reduction.

Hargrove 外骨骼机器人 肌电信号控制 运动意图识别","content":" Abstract— Active lower limb exoskeletons can provide assistance to the lower extremities and may drastically improve the walking abilities of millions of individuals with gait impairments. However, most currently available control systems for these devices cannot predict the user’s intended movements and have yet to enable walking with seamless transitions. Recent developments in intent recognition for active lower limb prostheses have demonstrated that using kinematic and kinetic signals from the device and myoelectric signals from the user can provide an intuitive control interface for seamlessly transitioning between different locomotor activities. In this work, we determined the baseline performance of intent recognition systems using neuromechanical signals presumably accessible for controlling active lower limb exoskeletons. We collected bilateral lower limb joint kinematics and muscle activity from three able-bodied subjects while they walked on level ground, ramps, and stairs in order to train an intent recognition system. We found that both combining kinematic and myoelectric signals and including signals from the contralateral leg significantly improved intent recognition performance. We achieved an average offline prediction error rate of 1.4 ± 0.90% using bilateral kinematic and myoelectric signals, demonstrating the promising potential of translating prosthesis-based intent recognition as an alternative control strategy for active lower limb exoskeletons. I. INTRODUCTION Worldwide, approximately 17 million individuals suffer a stroke and 375,000 suffer a spinal cord injury each year [1-2]. These conditions can lead to severe and lasting gait impairments that limit functional independence and reduce quality of life. Wearable robots such as active lower limb (LL) exoskeletons can assist these individuals in completing locomotor activities more independently by providing actuation at the hip, knee, and\/or ankle joints. Another application of these devices is human strength and endurance augmentation, which may enable individuals in military and industrial settings to perform load-bearing more safely and efficiently. Active LL exoskeletons have benefited greatly from technical improvements in mechatronic design, actuation, sensing, and energy efficiency and have proliferated in recent years (e.g. [3-6]).

To assess the biomechanical evidence in support of advocating the squat lifting technique as an administrative control  to prevent low back pain.  Background. Instruction with respect to lifting technique is commonly employed to prevent low back pain. The squat technique is the most widely advised lifting technique. Intervention studies failed to show health eects of this approach and consequently the rationale behind the advised lifting techniques has been questioned.  Methods. Biomechanical studies comparing the stoop and squat technique were systematically reviewed. The dependent variables used in these studies and the methods by which these were measured or estimated were ranked for validity as indicators of low back load.  Results. Spinal compression as indicated by intra-discal pressure and spinal shrinkage appeared not signiﬁcantly dierent be- tween both lifting techniques. Net moments and compression forces based on model estimates were found to be equal or somewhat higher in squat than in stoop lifting. Only when the load could be lifted from a position in between the feet did squat lifting cause lower net moments, although the studies reporting this ﬁnding had a marginal validity. Shear force and bending moments acting on the spine appeared lower in squat lifting. Net moments and compression forces during lifting reach magnitudes, that can probably cause injury, whereas shear forces and bending moments remained below injury threshold in both techniques.  Conclusion. The biomechanical literature does not provide support for advocating the squat technique as a means of preventing  low back pain.  Relevance  Training in lifting technique is widely used in primary and secondary prevention of low back pain, though health eects have not been proven. The present review assesses the biomechanical evidence supporting the most widely advocated lifting tech- nique.  1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To conquer these challenges, after many iterations and in- depth investigations, we have meticulously developed a full-size humanoid robot, “Adam”, whose innovative structural design greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the imitation learning process. In addition, we have developed a novel imita- tion learning framework based on an adversarial motion prior, which applies not only to Adam but also to humanoid robots in general. Using the framework, Adam can exhibit unprecedented human-like characteristics in locomotion tasks. Our experimen- tal results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables Adam to achieve human-comparable performance in complex locomotion tasks, marking the first time that human locomotion data has been used for imitation learning in a full-size humanoid robot.

MacLean and Daniel P. Ferris University of Florida  The authors tested 4 young healthy subjects walking with a powered knee exoskeleton to determine if it could reduce the metabolic cost of locomotion. Subjects walked with a backpack loaded and unloaded, on a treadmill with inclinations of 0° and 15°, and outdoors with varied natural terrain. Participants walked at a self-selected speed (average 1.0 m\/s) for all conditions, except incline treadmill walking (average 0.5 m\/s). The authors hypothesized that the knee exoskeleton would reduce the metabolic cost of walking uphill and with a load compared with walking without the exoskeleton. The knee exoskeleton reduced metabolic cost by 4.2% in the 15° incline with the backpack load. All other conditions had an increase in metabolic cost when using the knee exoskeleton compared with not using the exoskeleton. There was more variation in metabolic cost over the outdoor walking course with the knee exoskeleton than without it. Our ﬁndings indicate that powered assistance at the knee is more likely to decrease the metabolic cost of walking in uphill conditions and during loaded walking rather than in level conditions without a backpack load. Differences in positive mechanical work demand at the knee for varying conditions may explain the differences in metabolic beneﬁt from the exoskeleton.

Agrawal, Member, IEEE  Abstract Gait disorders and subsequent falls are major causes of chronic disability. Most falls occur during walking when an individual fails to recover from a loss of balance. We have developed an innovative cable-driven robot that delivers unpredictable waist-pull perturbations while walking on a treadmill. In previous experiments, we showed that a training induces acute motor session with repeated waist-pulls adaptations in gait and balance recovery reactions. To date, it is unknown if the effects can be transferred to different types of external balance perturbations.  This study aims to investigate if the exposure to repeated waist-pulls can improve the recovery reactions to slips. Fourteen healthy young adults were assigned to either an Experimental (EG) or a Control Group (CG). The EG was trained with multidirectional waist-pull perturbations of various intensities. The CG walked for a comparable amount of time on the treadmill with cables on, but without experiencing any waist- pull. Before and after the training, all participants were exposed to three slip-like perturbations by suddenly accelerating one belt of the treadmill in the forward direction. The Margin of Stability (MoS) was evaluated while reacting to the perturbations. At post-training, the EG showed increased stability in reaction to the waist-pull and slip-like perturbations. In contrast, the reaction to slip-like disturbances of the CG remained unchanged. A single session of gait training comprised of repeated waist-pulls showed immediate transfer to split-belt treadmill slips. The findings of this pilot study are encouraging for developing new fall prevention therapies.  I. INTRODUCTION  can be induced by a variety of external perturbations, e.g., tripping, slipping, misstep, incorrect weight shifting, collisions, etc. [2]. Moreover, even if we take one of these perturbations, the final effect on the human body is often unpredictable, because it depends on the amplitude, direction and timing of the disturbance [9, 10].","id":"0741eae2-2622-43f0-ba24-49fea939d855"}

Optimizing device characteristics on the basis of measured human performance could lead to improved designs. We have developed a method for identifying the exoskeleton assistance that minimizes human energy cost during walking. Optimized torque patterns from an exoskeleton worn on one ankle reduced metabolic energy consumption by 24.2 ± 7.4% compared to no torque. The approach was effective with exoskeletons worn on one or both ankles, during a variety of walking conditions, during running, and when optimizing muscle activity. Finding a good generic assistance pattern, customizing it to individual needs, and helping users learn to take advantage of the device all contributed to improved economy.

BLS has attracted increasing attention from many scholars owing to its excellent performance. This article proposes a weighted BLS (WBLS) based on BLS to tackle the noise and outliers in an industrial process. WBLS provides a uniﬁed framework for easily using different methods of calculating the weighted penalty factor. Using the weighted penalty factor to constrain the contribution of each sample to modeling, the normal and abnormal samples were allocated higher and lower weights to increase and decrease their contributions, respectively. Hence, the WBLS can eliminate the bad effect of noise and outliers  on the modeling. The weighted ridge regression algorithm is used to compute the algorithm solution. Weighted incremental learning algorithms are also developed using the weighted penalty factor to tackle the noise and outliers in the additional samples and quickly increase nodes or samples without retraining. The proposed weighted incremental learning algorithms provide a uniﬁed framework for using different methods of computing weights. We test the feasibility of the proposed algorithms on some public data sets and a real-world application. Experiment results show that our method has better generalization and robustness.","id":"11d16328-a924-4a75-8d1c-7dff2ea56541"}

Young , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Objective: Real-time measurement of biologi- cal joint moment could enhance clinical assessments and generalize exoskeleton control. Accessing joint moments outside clinical and laboratory settings requires harnessing non-invasive wearable sensor data for indirect estimation. Previous approaches have been primarily validated dur- ing cyclic tasks, such as walking, but these methods are likely limited when translating to non-cyclic tasks where the mapping from kinematics to moments is not unique. Methods: We trained deep learning models to estimate hip and knee joint moments from kinematic sensors, elec- tromyography (EMG), and simulated pressure insoles from a dataset including 10 cyclic and 18 non-cyclic activities. We assessed estimation error on combinations of sensor modalities during both activity types. Results: Compared to the kinematics-only baseline, adding EMG reduced RMSE by 16.9% at the hip and 30.4% at the knee (p < 0.05) and adding insoles reduced RMSE by 21.7% at the hip and 33.9% at the knee (p < 0.05). Adding both modalities re- duced RMSE by 32.5% at the hip and 41.2% at the knee (p < 0.05) which was signiﬁcantly higher than either modal- ity individually (p < 0.05).

Myers1,4, Iraklis I. Pipinos4,5, Philippe Malcolm1*  The metabolic rate of walking can be reduced by applying a constant forward force at the center of mass. It has been shown that the metabolically optimal constant force magnitude minimizes propulsion ground reaction force at the expense of increased braking. This led to the hypothesis that selectively assisting propulsion could lead to greater benefits. We used a robotic waist tether to evaluate the effects of forward forces with different timings and magnitudes. Here, we show that it is possible to reduce the metabolic rate of healthy participants by 48% with a greater efficiency ratio of metabolic cost reduction per unit of net aiding work compared with other assistive robots. This result was obtained using a sinusoidal force profile with peak timing during the middle of the double support. The same timing could also reduce the metabolic rate in patients with peripheral artery disease. A model explains that the optimal force profile accelerates the center of mass into the inverted pendulum movement during single support. Contrary to the hypothesis, the optimal force timing did not entirely coincide with propulsion. Within the field of wearable robotics, there is a trend to use devices to mimic biological torque or force profiles. Such bioinspired actuation can have relevant benefits; however, our results demonstrate that this is not neces- sarily optimal for reducing metabolic rate.","id":"89e22ef5-2cc9-4d27-b93f-fc4457b8dc73"}

Rouse1,2, and Talia Y. Moore1,2,3∗†‡  February 28, 2022  Abstract  Impressive animal locomotion capabilities are mediated by the co-evolution of the skeletal morphology and mus- cular properties. Legged robot performance would also likely beneﬁt from the co-optimization of actuators and leg morphology. However, development of custom actuators for legged robots is often expensive and time consuming, which discourages roboticists from pursuing performance gains aﬀorded by application-speciﬁc actuator optimization. This paper presents open-source designs for two quasi-direct-drive actuators with performance regimes appropriate for an 8–15 kg robot, built completely with oﬀ the shelf and 3D-printed components for less than $200 USD each. The mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of each actuator are characterized and compared to benchmark data. Actuators subjected to 420k strides of gait data experienced only a 2% reduction in eﬃciency and 26 mrad in backlash growth, demonstrating viability for rigorous and sustained research applications. We present a thermal solution that nearly doubles the thermally-driven torque limits of our plastic actuator design. The performance results are compa- rable to traditional metallic actuators for use in high-speed legged robots of the same scale. These 3D printed designs demonstrate an approach for designing and characterizing low-cost, highly customizable, and highly reproducible actuators, democratizing the ﬁeld of actuator design and enabling co-design and optimization of actuators and robot legs.  1 INTRODUCTION  Bioinspired legged robots have shown impressive agility, terrain traversal ability, and robustness [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, their performance capabilities are limited when compared to the diversity of terrestrial animals and their many forms of legged locomotion. The morphological features of robots also diﬀer greatly from their animal inspirations. The most popular mechanical designs have maximized simplicity and generality, typically featuring identical actuators and two-link legs across the robot [5].","id":"e148c63c-b3ba-4476-8623-6cf393e23f50"}

Martinez-Hernandez,3 H. Kim,3 S. K. Agrawal1,3*  Copyright © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science. No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Children with cerebral palsy commonly exhibit an abnormality called crouch gait, which is characterized by exces- sive flexion of the hips\/knees and weak plantar flexor muscles during the stance phase. One of the major reasons for this pathological gait is weakness in soleus muscles. During the mid-stance phase of gait when the toe and heel are both on the ground, the soleus keeps the shank upright and facilitates extension of the knee angle. It also provides propulsive forces on the body during the late stance phase of the gait cycle. We hypothesized that walk- ing with downward pelvic pull will (i) strengthen extensor muscles, especially the soleus, against the applied downward force and (ii) improve muscle coordination during walking. We then tested a robotic training paradigm to improve both posture and gait of children with crouch gait. In this paradigm, participants with crouch gait were subjected to downward pelvic force when walking on a treadmill, provided by a cable-driven robot called Tethered Pelvic Assist Device. Electromyography of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles and walking kinematics of the partici- pants showed the feasibility of this training, enhanced upright posture of the participants, and improved muscle coordination. In addition, walking features of these participants, such as increased step length, range of motion of the lower limb angles, toe clearance, and heel-to-toe pattern, improved. This robotic training method can be a promising intervention for children with cerebral palsy who have a crouch gait.  INTRODUCTION In the United States, 3.6 children out of every 1000 school-aged chil- dren have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy (CP) (1). These children show abnormal gait patterns, for example, jump gait, equinus gait, and crouch gait (2, 3). The crouch gait is characterized by excessive flexion of the hips, knees, or ankles (2, 4, 5). Children with crouch have slow walking speed, reduced range of motion of the joints (ROM), small step length, large body sway, and absence of a heel strike (6). In addition to other complications, crouch gait increases the energy cost of walking, causes pain, and results in joint degeneration over time (7).","id":"c1b9d70d-d598-46de-9927-e5bdad3bc64f"}

To improve the performance of BLDC motors, different control methods have been developed by many researchers. Those are such as the field weakening control method, overlapping method, PWM chopping method [3]-[6].  Abstract— The BLDC (Brushless DC) motor is characterized by linear torque to current and speed to voltage. It has low acoustic noise and fast dynamic response. Moreover, it has high power density with high proportion of torque to inertia in spite of small size drive. However, at high-speed operation, torque and speed response characteristic is deteriorated by the motor inductance components in stator windings. It is difficult that the BLDC motor is used to the industrial application requiring a wide range of operating speeds. Phase advance angle control method of different methods used to improve torque and speed response is used widely at high-speed operation. However, conventional phase advance angle control method was considered about forward motoring mode. Therefore, position information error of rotor that reverse motoring mode has phase lag angle of double is occurred. comparing with Consequently, torque performance is destroyed significantly. In this paper, a control method using adjustment of the phase advance angle is proposed. This proposed method improves the torque and speed response characteristic by minimizing delay of current at high-speed operation. Simulated results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparison with the conventional control method.","id":"48d2d09e-12a2-463b-aa98-d71fa131cb1e"}

Martin and Robert D. Gregg  Abstract—Predictive simulations of human walking could be used to in- vestigate a wide range of questions. Promising moderately complex models have been developed using the robotics control technique called hybrid zero dynamics (HZD). Existing simulations of human walking only con- sider the mean motion; therefore, they cannot be used to investigate fall risk, which is correlated with variability. This study determines how to in- corporate human-like variability into an HZD-based healthy human model to generate a more realistic gait. The key challenge is determining how to combine the existing mathematical description of variability with the dy- namic model so that the biped is still able to walk without falling. To do so, the commanded motion is augmented with a sinusoidal variability function and a polynomial correction function. The variability function captures the variationinjointangles,whilethecorrectionfunctionpreventsthevariabil- ity function from growing uncontrollably. The necessity of the correction function and the improvements with a reduction of stance ankle variability are demonstrated via simulations. The variability in temporal measures is shown to be similar to experimental values.  Index Terms—Biomimetics, human locomotion, legged robots, motion  control, variability.  I. INTRODUCTION  T HE ability to model and predict human gait can be used  to answer scientiﬁc questions that are difﬁcult or impos- sible to answer with human subject studies. For example, in- vestigations of periodic gait have provided insights into muscle contributions [1]. Further, predictive simulations could allow for preliminary testing of assistive devices, such as validating controllers for a powered leg prosthesis prior to hardware im- plementation with human amputee subjects [2].  Despite the common assumption that human gait is periodic, signiﬁcant variability exists. This variability has long-range cor- relationsbetweensteps[3],[4]andstructureatthejointlevel[5]. The joint-level variability has been mathematically described, but no attempt to incorporate it into a dynamic model has been made [5]. Increased variability is correlated with increased fall risk [3] but, somewhat surprisingly, variability and dynamic sta- bility are not equivalent [6].","id":"c461aebd-3f23-490a-8170-006da87ea5cd"}

We present the design and control of a multimodal locomotion robotic platform called LEONARDO, which bridges the gap between two different loco- motion regimes of flying and walking using synchronized control of distributed electric thrusters and a pair of multijoint legs. By combining two distinct locomotion mechanisms, LEONARDO achieves complex maneuvers that require delicate balancing, such as walking on a slackline and skateboarding, which are challenging for existing bipedal robots. LEONARDO also demonstrates agile walking motions, interlaced with flying maneuvers to over- come obstacles using synchronized control of propellers and leg joints. The mechanical design and synchronized control strategy achieve a unique multimodal locomotion capability that could potentially enable robotic missions and operations that would be difficult for single-modal locomotion robots.","id":"8b496de6-9df5-49c0-be53-ad1f557c6468"}

Kevin Best, Cara Gonzalez Welker, Elliott J. Rouse, and Robert D. Gregg  Abstract—Most impedance-based walking controllers for pow- ered knee-ankle prostheses use a ﬁnite state machine with dozens of user-speciﬁc parameters that require manual tuning by technical experts. These parameters are only appropriate near the task (e.g., walking speed and incline) at which they were tuned, necessitating many different parameter sets for variable-task walking. In contrast, this paper presents a data- driven, phase-based controller for variable-task walking that uses continuously-variable impedance control during stance and kinematic control during swing to enable biomimetic locomotion. After generating a data-driven model of variable joint impedance with convex optimization, we implement a novel task-invariant phase variable and real-time estimates of speed and incline to enable autonomous task adaptation. Experiments with above- knee amputee participants (N=2) show that our data-driven controller 1) features highly-linear phase estimates and accurate task estimates, 2) produces biomimetic kinematic and kinetic trends as task varies, leading to low errors relative to able-bodied references, and 3) produces biomimetic joint work and cadence trends as task varies. We show that the presented controller meets and often exceeds the performance of a benchmark ﬁnite state machine controller for our two participants, without requiring manual impedance tuning.

The orthotic compo- nents consist of electromechanical joints that lock and unlock automatically to provide upright stability and free movement powered by FES. Preliminary results from a prototype device on nondisabled and SCI volunteers are presented. A novel vari- able coupling hip-reciprocating mechanism either acts as a standard reciprocating gait orthosis or allows each hip to inde- pendently lock or rotate freely. Rotary actuators at each hip are configured in a closed hydraulic circuit and regulated by a finite state postural controller based on real-time sensor infor- mation. The knee mechanism locks during stance to prevent collapse and unlocks during swing, while the ankle is con- strained to move in the sagittal plane under FES-only control. The trunk is fixed in a rigid corset, and new ankle and trunk mechanisms are under development. Because the exoskeletal control mechanisms were built from off-the-shelf components, weight and cosmesis specifications for clinical use have not been met, although the power requirements are low enough to provide more than 4 hours of continuous operation with standard camcorder batteries.

So far, most neuromechanical simulation studies have focused on demonstrating the capability of a proposed control model these models with competing control hypotheses can generate human-like normal walking behaviors, a more in-depth evaluation is required. Here, we conduct the more in-depth evaluation on a spinal-reﬂex-based control model using ﬁve representative gait disturbances, ranging from electrical stimulation to mechanical perturbation at individual leg joints and at the whole body. The immediate changes in muscle activations of the model are compared to those of humans across different gait phases and disturbance magnitudes. Remarkably similar response trends for the majority of investigated muscles and experimental conditions reinforce the plausibility of the reﬂex circuits of the model. However, the model’s responses lack in amplitude for two experiments with whole body disturbances suggesting that in these cases the proposed reﬂex circuits need to be ampliﬁed by additional control structures such as location-speciﬁc cutaneous reﬂexes. A model that captures these selective ampliﬁcations would be able to explain both steady and reactive spinal control of human locomotion.

This controller is based on the time delayed, self-feedback known for stabilizing oscillatory systems under certain conditions.

The controller provides immediate and smooth assistance to user movement by reﬂecting the change of leg motion at every control period. The proposed joint-angle- based delayed-feedback assistance controller can operate under various walking speeds and environmental changes (e.g., stairs and ramps) without the need for additional sensors, computational processing, and parameter adjustment.

First published May 7, 2009; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.91609.2008.— During bouncing gaits such as hopping and running, leg muscles generate force to enable elastic energy storage and return primarily from tendons and, thus, demand metabolic energy. In an effort to reduce metabolic demand, we designed two elastic leg exoskeletons that act in parallel with the wearer’s legs; one exoskeleton consisted of a multiple leaf (MLE) and the other of a single leaf (SLE) set of ﬁberglass springs. We hypothesized that hoppers, hopping on both legs, would adjust their leg stiffness while wearing an exoskeleton so that the combination of the hopper and exoskeleton would behave as a linear spring-mass system with the same total stiffness as during normal hopping. We also hypothesized that decreased leg force generation while wearing an exoskeleton would reduce the metabolic power required for hopping. Nine subjects hopped in place at 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 Hz with and without an exoskeleton while we measured ground reaction forces, exoskeletal compression, and metabolic rates. While wearing an exoskeleton, hoppers adjusted their leg stiffness to maintain linear spring-mass mechanics and a total stiffness similar to normal hopping. Without accounting for the added weight of each exoskeleton, wearing the MLE reduced net metabolic power by an average of 6% and wearing the SLE reduced net metabolic power by an average of 24% compared with hopping normally at frequencies between 2.0 and 2.6 Hz. Thus, when hoppers used external parallel springs, they likely decreased the mechanical work performed by the legs and substantially reduced metabolic demand compared with hopping without wearing an exoskeleton.","id":"9a23803c-b3f5-4a5b-8c56-0c986f36bf74"}

Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 23% when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg.  Methods: We used human-in the-loop optimization to optimize hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance with no additional load, a light load (15% of body weight), and a heavy load (30% of body weight) for three participants. All loads were applied through a weight vest with an attached waist belt. We measured metabolic cost, exoskeleton assistance, kinematics, and muscle activity. We performed one-tailed paired t-tests to determine signiﬁcant reductions for metabolic cost and muscle activity, and we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine signiﬁcant changes across load conditions for metabolic cost and applied power.  Results: Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking relative to walking in the device without assistance for all tested conditions. Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 47% with no load (p = 0.02), 35% with the light load (p = 0.03), and 43% with the heavy load (p = 0.02). The smaller metabolic reduction with the light load may be due to insuﬃcient participant training or lack of optimizer convergence. The total applied positive power was similar for all tested conditions, and the positive knee power decreased slightly as load increased. Optimized torque timing parameters were consistent across participants and load conditions while optimized magnitude parameters varied.","id":"55c10e03-19a8-4b12-a219-de6a7027daf2"}

Some studies obtained this result by means of high positive work assistance while others combined negative and positive work assistance. There is no consensus about the isolated contribution of negative work assistance. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to examine the effect of varying negative work assistance at the ankle joint while maintaining a fixed level of positive work assistance with a multi-articular soft exosuit. Methods: We tested eight participants during walking at 1.5 ms−1 with a 23-kg backpack. Participants wore a version of the exosuit that assisted plantarflexion via Bowden cables tethered to an off-board actuation platform. In four active conditions we provided different rates of exosuit bilateral ankle negative work assistance ranging from 0. 015 to 0.037 W kg−1 and a fixed rate of positive work assistance of 0.19 W kg−1. Results: All active conditions significantly reduced metabolic rate by 11 to 15% compared to a reference condition, where the participants wore the exosuit but no assistance was provided. We found no significant effect of negative work assistance. However, there was a trend (p = .08) toward greater reduction in metabolic rate with increasing negative work assistance, which could be explained by observed reductions in biological ankle and hip joint power and moment.  Conclusions: The non-significant trend of increasing negative work assistance with increasing reductions in metabolic rate motivates the value in further studies on the relative effects of negative and positive work assistance. There may be benefit in varying negative work over a greater range or in isolation from positive work assistance.","id":"9ed49892-ed7f-44d8-9ee0-ada434ada421"}

Herr, IEEE Member  Abstract— Although great advances have been made in the design and control of lower extremity prostheses, walking on different terrains, such as ramps or stairs, and transitioning between these terrains remains a major challenge for the field. In order to generalize biomimetic behaviour of active lower- limb prostheses top-down volitional control is required but has until recently been deemed unfeasible due to the difficulties involved in acquiring an adequate electromyographic (EMG) signal. In this study, we hypothesize that a transtibial amputee can extend the functionality of a hybrid controller, designed for level ground walking, to stair ascent and descent by volitionally modulating powered plantar-flexion of the prosthesis. We here present data illustrating that the participant is able to reproduce ankle push-off behaviour of the intrinsic controller during stair ascent as well as prevent inadvertent push-off during stair descent. Our findings suggest that EMG signal from the residual limb muscles can be used to transition between level-ground walking and stair ascent\/descent within a single step and significantly improve prosthesis performance during stair-ambulation.  We here present preliminary clinical data on a hybrid, a volitional EMG neuromuscular reflex-model framework (positive force feedback [12, 13]). Unlike previous studies, user intention is not used to derive state transitions but to proportionally control push-off by a powered ankle-foot prosthesis, as recently illustrated for level ground walking [14]. We hypothesized that volitional control enables the amputee to generalize the behavior of the level ground walking state machine to stair ascent and descent, even though walking states differ between these three types of gait [15]. In particular we hypothesized that a) the amputee would be able to produce push-off torques and toe-off ankle angles comparable to that generated using the intrinsic controller and the biological limb during stair ascent and b) to prevent inadvertent ankle push-off during stair descent.  controller  implemented within  II.

Yet, little is known about how the prosthesis mechanics\/control inﬂu- ence wearer-prosthesis’ gait performance, such as gait symmetry, stability, etc. This study aimed to investigate the inﬂuence of robotic transfemoral prosthesis mechanics on human wearers’ gait symmetry. The investigation was enabled by our previously designed reinforcement learning (RL) supplementary control, which simultaneously tuned 12 control parameters that deter- mined the prosthesis mechanics throughout a gait cycle. The RL control design facilitated safe explorations of prosthesis mechanics with the human in the loop. Subjects were recruited and walked with a robotic transfemoral prosthesis on a treadmill while the RL controller tuned the control parameters. Stance time symmetry, step length symmetry, and bilateral anteroposterior (AP) impulses were measured. The data analysis showed that changes in robotic knee mechanics led to movement variations in both lower limbs and therefore gait temporal-spatial symmetry measures. Consistent across all inter-limb AP impulse measurements explained gait symmetry: the stance time symmetry was signiﬁcantly correlated with the net inter-limb AP impulse, and the step length symmetry was signiﬁcantly correlated with braking and propulsive impulse symmetry. The results suggest that it is possible to personalize transfemoral prosthesis control for improved temporal-spatial gait symmetry. However, adjusting prosthesis mechanics alone was insufﬁcient to maximize the gait symmetry. Rather, achieving gait symmetry may require coordination between the wearer’s motor control of the intact limb and adaptive control of the prosthetic joints.

For this time-invariant ESC, we propose a method to prove the closed loop system has an asymptotically stable limit cycle. The method is based on a perturbation theorem for maps, and, unlike existing techniques that use averaging and singular perturbation tools, it is not limited to weakly nonlinear systems. We use a typical example system to show that our method does indeed establish asymptotic stability of the limit cycle with minimal amplitude.

However, there are applications where the plant does not operate at a ﬁxed time-scale. Human locomotion is one example, which exhibits varying time-scales based on the walking speed) [11]. In a transfemoral powered prosthetic leg, the evolution of the knee and the ankle joints are typically synchronized to an external signal, e.g., the human’s hip signal [12], [13]. In the application of time-based ESC with such periodic systems with varying time-scales, if the desired task results in slow operation speed, then the use of ﬁxed time- based ESC parameters would violate the time-scale separation thus, the ESC adaptation can no longer be guaranteed to be stable [14]. Although newer forms of ESC using high- frequency dither signals can handle varying time-scales [15]– [17], the introduction of fast oscillations in the system might be undesirable for precise trajectory tracking applications.  Limit cycles occur in numerous engineering applications, e.g., tracking error response in rehabilitation robots [1], self- excited vibrations in automotive braking systems [2], oscil- latory wing response in aircraft [3], which can limit the performance and safety of the system. Feedback control can reduce the size of the limit cycle but cannot completely eliminate it. To improve performance, the control requirement is often to enforce a “smallest”, stable limit cycle.","id":"746af1ba-9a55-43bf-9d38-ba029cb23a45"}

The self-selected walking velocity was used as a covariate in the analysis to ensure that group differences were not due to differences in walking velocity between the MS and healthy control groups. Reduced angular range, less joint torque, and reduced joint power were seen in patients with MS. We also found significant correlations between biomechanical gait parameters and EDSS score, which provides a clinical rating of disease severity.

There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in knee motion between the patients and normal subjects. The patients with knee OA had a signiﬁcantly reduced internal knee extensor moment compared to normal subjects. This diﬀerence reﬂects the patient’s compensation to reduce the knee joint loading. Further, subjects with OA and a higher body mass index have a lower knee extensor moment. The female subjects had signiﬁcantly greater knee ﬂexion and a greater knee extensor moment. This gender diﬀerence may partially explain the increased prevalence of OA in females. Most tests of OA treatments are assessed by criteria that do not reﬂect functional activities. This study demonstrates that objective gait analysis can be used to document gait adaptations used by patients with knee OA. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This disease is particularly disabling when the knees are aﬀected. It is estimated that 9% of men and 18% of women over age 65 have knee OA (Davis et al., 1991). Individuals with knee OA experience pain, stiﬀness, and decreased range of motion of the joints. These symptoms signiﬁcantly limit an individual’s ability to rise from a chair, stand comfor- tably, walk, or climb stairs. Ultimately, these limitations lead to a loss of functional independence.  The mechanics of walking on a level surface are well understood and characterized (Bresler and Frankel, 1950; Perry, 1992). Several studies have also analyzed the mechanics of stair walking. Kinematic and kinetic data of the lower limb in the sagittal plane during stair ascent and descent have been described in the sagittal plane (Andriacchi et al., 1980; McFadyen and Winter, 1988), and the frontal plane (Andriacchi et al., 1980;","id":"1cb7f505-9273-4ab9-91a8-2c41fbef3455"}

In humans, a large portion of the mechanical work required for walking comes from muscle-tendons crossing the ankle joint. Elastic energy storage and return in the Achilles tendon during each step enhance the efficiency of ankle muscle-tendon mechanical work far beyond what is possible for work performed by knee and hip joint muscle-tendons. Key Words: gait, locomotion, walking, energetics, exoskeleton, efficiency  INTRODUCTION  Human walking mechanics have long been described using an inverted pendulum analogy (5). The body center of mass travels in an arc trajectory such that it rises and decelerates during the first half of stance, and lowers and accelerates during the second half of stance, similar to an inverted pendulum. By coupling a regular pendulum to an inverted pendulum to make a swing leg and a stance leg, a simple passive model can reproduce the basic movement and energy patterns of human walking (15,20). Despite their simplicity, passive pendular models make a number of key predictions about the energetics of bipedal walking. First, energy can be conserved by exchanging kinetic and gravita- tional potential energy during the stance phase of each step. Second, leg swing can be purely passive under certain initial conditions. Third, the major source of energy loss during walking is the step-to-step transition (16). At this time, the center of mass must be redirected from moving downward and forward to moving upward and forward. This redirection requires mechanical work to maintain steady speed walking dynamics (16).  Simple models also provide insight into how the mechan- ical energy lost in the foot-ground collision is replaced by positive mechanical work performed by the legs. One way to perform the work is to generate an impulsive push-off along the trailing limb just before the leading limb collides with  the ground. An alternative way to power level walking in the model is to use active hip torque (15). Either of these methods could be done solely with active power production or by supplementing active power production with recovered energy that was previously stored in elastic elements.","id":"49539129-b874-4998-8289-f477ad875f74"}

Rouse, Member,IEEE  Abstract—The majority of commercially available pas- sive prosthetic feet are not capable of providing joint mechanics that match that of the intact human ankle. Due to their cantilever design, their stiffness characteristics contrast with what has been observed in the biological ankle, namely, an increase in stiffness during the stance phase of walking. In this paper, we introduce the design and control of a pneumatic foot-ankle prosthesis that attempts to provide biomimetic mechanics. The prosthesis is com- prised of a pneumatic cylinder in series with a ﬁberglass leaf spring, and a solenoid valve to control the ﬂow of air between the two sides of the cylinder. The solenoid valve acts as a mechanical clutch, enabling resetting of the ankle’s equilibrium position. By adjusting the pressure inside the cylinder, the prosthesis can be customized to provide a range of ankle mechanics. A mechanical testing machine is used to compare the torque-angle curve of the pneumatic prosthesis with a low-proﬁle passive prosthetic foot. Finally, data are presented of one transtibial amputee walking with the prosthesis at 1.2 m\/s. The testing shows that the pneumatic prosthesis is capable of providing an appropriate range of motion as well a maximum torque of 94 Nm, while returning approximately 11.5 J of energy.","id":"df17feb7-3b0c-4352-8630-1836b12bdd94"}

A biomechanical comparison of back and front squats in healthy trained individuals. J Strength Cond Res 23(1): 284–292, 2008—The strength and stability of the knee plays an integral role in athletics and activities of daily living. A better under- standing of knee joint biomechanics while performing variations in rehabilitation and exercise of the squat would be useful prescription. We quantiﬁed and compared tibiofemoral joint kinetics as well as muscle activity while executing front and back squats. Because of the inherent change in the position of the center of mass of the bar between the front and back squat lifts, we hypothesized that the back squat would result in increased loads on the knee joint and that the front squat would result in increased knee extensor and decreased back extensor muscle activity. A crossover study design was used. To assess the net force and torque placed on the knee and muscle activation levels, a combination of video and force data, as well as surface electromyographic data, were collected from 15 healthy trained individuals. The back squat resulted in signiﬁcantly higher compressive forces and knee extensor moments than the front squat. Shear forces at the knee were in magnitude, posteriorly directed, and did not vary small between the squat variations. Although bar position did not inﬂuence muscle activity, muscle activation during the ascending phase was signiﬁcantly greater than during the descending phase. The front squat was as effective as the back squat in terms of overall muscle recruitment, with signiﬁcantly less com- pressive forces and extensor moments. The results suggest that front squats may be advantageous compared with back squats for individuals with knee problems such as meniscus tears, and for long-term joint health.

The proposed hybrid knee uses a spring-damper system in combination with an electric motor and transmission system, which can be engaged to provide a stair ambulation capability. In comparison to fully powered pros- theses that power all ambulation activities, a hybrid knee prosthesis can achieve significant weight reduction by focusing the design of the actuator on a subset of activities without losing the ability to produce equivalent torque and mechanical power in the active mode. The hybrid knee prototype weighs 1.7 kg, including battery and control, and can provide up to 125 Nm of repetitive torque. Experiments with two transfemoral amputee subjects show that the proposed hybrid knee prosthesis can support walking on level ground in the passive mode, as well as stair ambulation with a reciprocal gait pattern in the active mode.

Introduction  Lower-limb amputation affects the ambulation abilities and quality of life of roughly 600,000 individuals in the USA alone (Adams et al., 1999). By 2050, the number of ampu- tees is expected to more than double, mainly due to the pre- valence of peripheral vascular disease (Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008). Individuals with a transfemoral amputation typically walk slower, expend more energy, and have a higher fall risk than able-bodied individuals (Schmalz et al., 2002). Furthermore, ambulation activities, such as climbing ramps and stairs or standing up from a seated position, are much more difficult for amputees than for able-bodied indi- viduals. Therefore, advances in prosthetic technologies are needed to improve the ability of individuals to ambulate after above-knee amputation.","id":"81dca35b-e009-455b-8f8a-557df3885939"}

Since the energy supplied by the proposed EMG is discontinuous in time, a tailored energy management circuit is necessary to adapt the harvested energy to the load energy requirements. The electromechanical generator is composed by two series of NdFeB magnets positioned into each condyle and a coil, placed in the pin of the tibial insert, which collects the magnetic flux variations, generated by the knee movements. A total knee replacement (TKR) prototype has been developed and realized in order to reproduce the knee mechanics. Therefore, electrical performances have been evaluated, at the first, measuring the EMG open circuit voltage by means of a high impedance buffer amplifier, and, subsequently, connecting the EMG to the energy management circuit able to manage the produced energy and to power an implanted circuit for force measurement inside the human knee. The tests showed that the EHS is able to supply the measuring circuit guaranteeing a tension between 2.45 V and 2.15 V for 25 ms almost every 1.5 s with a walking velocity of 1 Hz. The tests successfully demonstrate the possibility to power a measurement circuit transmitting the measurement data outside the prosthesis every about one-step and half.

The control system leverages communication between the prostheses for enhanced awareness and stability, along with power generation at the knee and ankle joints to better restore biomechanical functionality in level ground walking. The control methodology employed is a combination of an impedance-based framework for weight-bearing portions of gait and a trajectory- based approach for the nonweight-bearing portions. The control system was implemented on a pair of self-contained powered knee and ankle prostheses, and the ability of the prostheses and control approach to provide walking functionality was assessed in a set of experimental trials with a bilateral transfemoral amputee subject. Speciﬁcally, experimental data from these trials indicate that the powered prostheses and bilateral control architecture provide gait kinematics that reproduce healthy gait kinematics to a greater extent than the subject’s daily-use passive prostheses.

In this paper, we proposed a novel soft knee exoskeleton based on continuum structure. The bionic design is from the knee exten- sion mechanism: extensor contraction stretching the patella on the gap of the femur and tibia. Concept and prototype design were presented in detail. In the continuum structure, two adjacent modules have two major degrees of freedom, which are bilateral siding and unilateral rotation. The end motion area of the continuum can meet the knee joint feature which is coupled motion with sliding and rotating between the femur and tibia. In addition, a high-power cable-driven actuator was developed to drive the exoskeleton. Tension control results indicated that the actuator can track the force quickly and accurately at fast movement. Walking experi- ments on two subjects wearing the proposed exoskeleton at slow, normal and fast speeds were carried out. Knee joint kinematic data show ﬂexible and natural gait motion.  Keywords: Soft exoskeleton · Cable-driven and continuum  1 Introduction  Lower-limb exoskeletons have been proposed and developed in military or medi- cal applications, aiming for human argumentation, motion aid and rehabilitation training [1]. Recently, soft exoskeletons as a research focus, use cables anchored to the human body by soft fabric to transfer power. They have several advan- tages compared with the rigid ones composed of rigid links and simpliﬁed joints. At ﬁrst, no robotic joint means there is no misalignment and constrain problem between the human joint and the exoskeleton joint due to complexity and multi- degrees of freedom (DoF) of biologic joint. Secondly, the soft exoskeleton can be made lightweight and compact. These can obtain more ﬂexible and natural motion during the human gait assistance, e.g. highly dynamic locomotion [2]. c Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 H. Yu et al.

Walsh1‡  Walking and running have fundamentally different biomechanics, which makes developing devices that assist both gaits challenging. We show that a portable exosuit that assists hip extension can reduce the metabolic rate of treadmill walking at 1.5 meters per second by 9.3% and that of running at 2.5 meters per second by 4.0% compared with locomotion without the exosuit. These reduction magnitudes are comparable to the effects of taking off 7.4 and 5.7 kilograms during walking and running, respectively, and are in a range that has shown meaningful athletic performance changes. The exosuit automatically switches between actuation profiles for both gaits, on the basis of estimated potential energy fluctuations of the wearer’s center of mass. Single-participant experiments show that it is possible to reduce metabolic rates of different running speeds and uphill walking, further demonstrating the exosuit’s versatility.  H umanscan walkand run to attain a wider  speed range. At low speeds, the metabolic rate of walking is lower than that of run- ning, but this tendency is reversed at higher speeds, such that at high speeds the metabolic rate of running is lower than that of walking. The ability to switch between walk- ing and running allows humans to adopt the gait with the lowest metabolic rate at each speed (fig. S1A) (1, 2). Development of robotic assistive de- vices that can provide benefits for both walking and running is challenging because of the fun- damentallydifferentbiomechanicsofthesegaits (3).

I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external. Specifically, a number of researchers have investigated the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) to artificially control leg muscle contraction, thereby utilizing the metabolic power supply of the paraplegic subject to facilitate legged locomotion. Some of the research efforts in this regard include [1-3]. Note that, in addition to providing power for locomotion, FES-aided gait has also been shown to provide a number of associated physiological benefits, some of which include increased muscle strength, increased bone density, decreased spasticity, and improved cardiovascular health [4-6]. Despite this, FES-based systems entail a number of challenges; most notably, (1) in the absence of adequate sensory information muscles are difficult to control, and (2) the rapid muscle fatigue promote by the synchronous recruitment of muscle fibers occurred in FES. Rather than utilize the metabolic power source provided by stimulated muscle, other researchers have developed lower limb exoskeletons, which utilize external power (e.g., a battery pack) to provide a source of motive power to facilitate legged locomotion.

Linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were used for calibration, and 10-fold cross-validation was applied to estimate the system’s accuracy. Results indicate that machine learning regression methods may lead to improved accuracy, but the choice of the kernel function is critical. Gaussian kernel yielded root-mean-square errors (RSME) of 2.5N or less relative to force plates, while other kernel functions produced more less accurate results.

ACCEPTED DECEMBER, 2023  Robustification of Bayesian-Inference-Based Gait Estimation for Lower-limb Wearable Robots Ting-Wei Hsu1, Robert D. Gregg2, and Gray C. Thomas3  Abstract—Lower-limb wearable robots designed to assist peo- ple in everyday activities must reliably recover from any mo- mentary confusion about what the user is doing. Such confusion might arise from momentary sensor failure, collision with an obstacle, losing track of gait due to an out-of-distribution stride, etc. Systems that infer a user’s walking condition from angle measurements using Bayesian filters (e.g., extended Kalman filters) have been shown to accurately track gait across a range of activities. However, due to the fundamental problem structure and assumptions of Bayesian filter implementations, such estimators risk becoming ‘lost’ with little hope of a quick recovery. In this paper, we 1) introduce a Monte Carlo- based metric to quantify the robustness of pattern-tracking gait estimators, 2) propose strategies for improving tracking robustness, and 3) systematically evaluate them against this new metric using a publicly available gait biomechanics dataset. Our results, aggregating 2,700 trials of simulated walking of 10 able- bodied subjects under random perturbations, suggest that drastic improvements in robustness (from 8.9% to 99%) are possible using relatively simple modifications to the estimation process without noticeably degrading estimator accuracy.

Gregg2,3  Abstract—This paper presents the design and validation of a backdrivable powered knee orthosis for partial assistance of lower-limb musculature, which aims to facilitate daily activities in individuals with musculoskeletal disorders. The actuator design is guided by design principles that prioritize backdrivability, output torque, and compactness. First, we show that increasing the motor diameter while reducing the gear ratio for a ﬁxed output torque ultimately reduces the reﬂected inertia (and thus back- drive torque). We also identify a tradeoff with actuator torque density that can be addressed by improving the motor’s thermal environment, motivating our design of a custom Brushless DC motor with encapsulated windings. Finally, by designing a 7:1 planetary gearset directly into the stator, the actuator has a high package factor that reduces size and weight. Benchtop tests verify that the custom actuator can produce at least 23.9 Nm peak torque and 12.78 Nm continuous torque, yet has less than 2.68 Nm backdrive torque during walking conditions. Able- bodied human subjects experiments (N=3) demonstrate reduced quadriceps activation with bilateral orthosis assistance during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. The minimal transmission also produces negligible acoustic noise.  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"752f89a2-7883-4b42-b21a-f9cd6eb772a1"}

Gutierrez-Farewik  Abstract—Accurately predicting joint torque using wear- able sensors is crucial for designing assist-as-needed exoskeleton controllers to assist muscle-generated torque and ensure successful task performance. In this paper, we estimated ankle dorsiflexion\/plantarflexion, knee flex- ion\/extension, hip flexion\/extension, and hip abduc- tion\/adduction torques from electromyography (EMG) and kinematics during daily activities using neuromuscu- loskeletal (NMS) models and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The joint torque ground truth for model calibrating and training was obtained through inverse dynamics of captured motion data. A cluster approach that grouped movements based on characteristic simi- larity was implemented, and its ability to improve the estimation accuracy of both NMS and LSTM models was evaluated. We compared torque estimation accuracy of NMS and LSTM models in three cases: Pooled, Individual, and Clustered models. Pooled models used data from all 10 movements to calibrate or train one model, Individual models used data from each individual movement, and Clustered models used data from each cluster. Individual, Clustered and Pooled LSTM models all had relatively high joint torque estimation accuracy. Individual and Clustered NMS models had similarly good estimation performance whereas the Pooled model may be too generic to satisfy all movement patterns. While the cluster approach improved the estimation accuracy in NMS models in some move- ments, it made relatively little difference in the LSTM neural networks, which already had high estimation accuracy. Our study provides practical implications for designing assist- as-needed exoskeleton controllers by offering guidelines for selecting the appropriate model for different scenarios, and has potential to enhance the functionality of wearable exoskeletons and improve rehabilitation and assistance for individuals with motor disorders.

Emerging automatic tuning algorithms have shown promise to ease the device personalization procedure. However, very few automatic tuning algorithms consider the user preference as the tuning goal, which may limit the adoptability of the robotic prosthesis. In this study, we propose and evaluate a novel prosthesis control tun- ing framework for a robotic knee prosthesis, which could enable user preferred robot behavior in the device tuning process. The framework consists of 1) a User-Controlled Interface that allows the user to select their preferred knee kinematics in gait and 2) a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for tuning high-dimension prosthesis control parameters to meet the desired knee kinematics. We evalu- ated the performance of the framework along with usabil- ity of the developed user interface. In addition, we used the developed framework to investigate whether amputee users can exhibit a preference between different profiles during walking and whether they can differentiate between their preferred profile and other profiles when blinded. The results showed effectiveness of our developed framework in tuning 12 robotic knee prosthesis control parameters while meeting the user-selected knee kinematics. A blinded comparative study showed that users can accurately and consistently identify their preferred prosthetic control knee profile. Further, we preliminarily examined gait biomechan- ics of the prosthesis users when walking with different prosthesis control and did not find clear difference between walking with preferred prosthesis control and when walking with normative gait control parameters. This study may inform future translation of this novel prosthesis tuning framework for home or clinical use.

Walsh1,2*  Abstract  Background: Soft exosuits are a recent approach for assisting human locomotion, which apply assistive torques to the wearer through functional apparel. Over the past few years, there has been growing recognition of the importance of control individualization for such gait assistive devices to maximize benefit to the wearer. In this paper, we present an updated version of autonomous multi-joint soft exosuit, including an online parameter tuning method that customizes control parameters for each individual based on positive ankle augmentation power.  Methods: The soft exosuit is designed to assist with plantarflexion, hip flexion, and hip extension while walking. A mobile actuation system is mounted on a military rucksack, and forces generated by the actuation system are transmitted via Bowden cables to the exosuit. The controller performs an iterative force-based position control of the Bowden cables on a step-by-step basis, delivering multi-articular (plantarflexion and hip flexion) assistance during push-off and hip extension assistance in early stance. To individualize the multi-articular assistance, an online parameter tuning method was developed that customizes two control parameters to maximize the positive augmentation power delivered to the ankle. To investigate the metabolic efficacy of the exosuit with wearer-specific parameters, human subject testing was conducted involving walking on a treadmill at 1.50 m s−1 carrying a 6.8-kg loaded rucksack. Seven participants underwent the tuning process, and the metabolic cost of loaded walking was measured with and without wearing the exosuit using the individualized control parameters.","id":"c1f76a87-2a7f-4b2f-9455-d5387207b2d8"}

This work aimed to investigate energetic adaptations occurring over multiple training sessions, while walking with a soft exosuit assisting the hip joint. The participants attended five training sessions within 20 days. They walked carrying a load of 20.4 kg for 20 minutes with the exosuit powered and five minutes with the exosuit unpowered. Percentage change in net metabolic cost between the powered and unpowered conditions improved across sessions from −6.2 ± 3.9% (session one) to −10.3 ± 4.7% (session five), indicating a significant effect associated with training. The percentage change at session three (−10.5 ± 4.5%) was similar to the percentage change at session five, indicating that two 20-minute sessions may be sufficient for users to fully adapt and maximize the metabolic benefit provided by the exoskeleton. Retention was also tested measuring the metabolic reduction five months after the last training session. The percent change in metabolic cost during this session (−10.1 ± 3.2%) was similar to the last training session, indicating that the adaptations resulting in reduced metabolic cost are preserved. These outcomes are relevant when evaluating exoskeletons’ performance on naïve users, with a specific focus on hip extension assistance.","id":"f32f524b-bd38-4716-9ff9-9630395f0810"}

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Humans can precisely sense the position, speed, and torque of their body parts. This sense is known as proprio- ception and is essential to human motor control. Although there have been many attempts to create human- mechatronic interactions, there is still no robust, repeatable methodology to reflect proprioceptive information from a synthetic device onto the nervous system. To address this shortcoming, we present an agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI). The AMI is composed of (i) a surgical construct made up of two muscle-tendons—an agonist and an antagonist—surgically connected in series so that contraction of one muscle stretches the other and (ii) a bidirectional efferent-afferent neural control architecture. The AMI preserves the dynamic muscle rela- tionships that exist within native anatomy, thereby allowing proprioceptive signals from mechanoreceptors within both muscles to be communicated to the central nervous system. We surgically constructed two AMIs within the residual limb of a subject with a transtibial amputation. Each AMI sends control signals to one joint of a two-degree- of-freedom ankle-foot prosthesis and provides proprioceptive information pertaining to the movement of that joint. The AMI subject displayed improved control over the prosthesis compared to a group of four subjects having traditional amputation. We also show natural reflexive behaviors during stair ambulation in the AMI subject that do not appear in the cohort of subjects with traditional amputation. In addition, we demonstrate a system for closed-loop joint torque control in AMI subjects. These results provide a framework for integrating bionic systems with human physiology.","id":"afd15bb6-5009-4e7f-8209-704f4a72eca3"}

Abstract: Cycling stands as one of the most widely embraced leisure activities and serves purposes such as exercise, rehabilitation, and commuting. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of assisting three unimpaired participants (age: 34.0 ± 7.9 years, height: 1.86 ± 0.02 m, weight: 75.7 ± 12.7 kg) using the GuroX hip exoskeleton, originally designed for walking assistance, during cycling against a resistance of 1W\/kg. The performance evaluation employed a sweep protocol that manipulated the timing of the exoskeleton’s peak extension and flexion torque in addition to human-in-the-loop optimization to enhance these timings based on metabolic cost. Our findings indicate that with a peak assistance torque of approximately 10.3Nm for extension and flexion, the GuroX substantially reduced the net metabolic cost of cycling by 31.4 ± 8.1% and 26.4 ± 14.1% compared to transparent and without exoskeleton conditions, respectively. This demonstrates the significant potential of a hip exoskeleton developed for walking assistance to profoundly benefit cycling. Additionally, customizing the assistance strategy proves beneficial in maximizing assistance. While we attribute the average motor power to be a major contributor to the reduced cycling effort, participant feedback suggests that user comfort and synchronization between the user and exoskeleton may have played integral roles. Further research should validate our initial findings by employing a larger participant pool in real-world conditions. Incorporating a more diverse set of parameters for the human-in-the- loop optimization could enhance individualized assistance strategies.

Sarkisian, Marshall K. Ishmael, Grace R. Hunt, and Tommaso Lenzi, Member, IEEE  Abstract— Powered knee exoskeletons aim to assist individuals with lower limb impairments by providing power and torque at the joint level. However, if the anatomical and exoskeleton joints are not perfectly aligned, the exoskeleton assistance may result in spurious forces and torques transferred to the user’s limb. These spurious forces and torques can then generate undesired loads on the user’s joint and shear stress on the user’s skin, causing pain and ultimately undermining the exoskeleton assistance. To address this issue, we propose a novel powered knee exoskeleton with a self-aligning mechanism using a prismatic-revolute- revolute (PRR) configuration. The proposed self-aligning mechanism weighs 190 g (i.e., 5.3% of the total exoskeleton weight) and can transmit up to 120 Nm of torque at the knee joint (i.e., biological peak torque for a 50th percentile male climbing stairs). Our experiments show that during assisted sit-to-stand transfers the peaks of the spurious torques and forces are below 0.5 Nm and 5 N, respectively, even if misalignments are intentionally added between the user and the exoskeleton. This study supports the use of self-aligning mechanisms in powered exoskeletons.  are neglected, perfect static alignment between the powered and anatomical axes is not possible as the anatomical axis cannot be located accurately when wearing the powered exoskeleton.

Collins  Exoskeletons can enhance human mobility, but we still know little about why they are effective. For example, we do not know the relative importance of training, how much is required, or what type is most effective; how people adapt with the device; or the relative benefits of customizing assistance. We conducted experiments in which naïve users learned to walk with ankle exoskeletons under one of three training regimens characterized by differ- ent levels of variation in device behavior. Assistance was also customized for one group. After moderate-variation training, the benefits of customized assistance were large; metabolic rate was reduced by 39% compared with walking with the exoskeleton turned off. Training contributed about half of this benefit and customization about one-quarter; a generic controller reduced energy cost by 10% before training and 31% afterward. Training re- quired much more exposure than typical of exoskeleton studies, about 109 minutes of assisted walking. Type of training also had a strong effect; the low-variation group required twice as long as the moderate-variation group to become expert, and the high-variation group never acquired this level of expertise. Curiously, all users adapted in a way that resulted in less mechanical power from the exoskeleton as they gained expertise. Customizing assist- ance required less time than training for all parameters except peak torque magnitude, which grew slowly over the study, suggesting a longer time scale adaptation in the person. These results underscore the importance of training to the benefits of exoskeleton assistance and suggest the topic deserves more attention.","id":"b2c54d47-7404-4180-b18b-8f3718dacdb3"}

Bolus, Student Member, IEEE, Hyeon Ki Jeong, Bradley M. Blaho, Mohsen Safaei, Aaron J. Young, Omer T. Inan, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract— Objective: Tendons are essential components of the musculoskeletal system and, as with any mechanical structure, can fail under load. Tendon injuries are common and can be debilitating, and research suggests that a better understanding of their loading conditions could help mitigate injury risk and improve rehabilitation. To that end, we present a novel method of noninvasively assessing parameters related to mechanical load in the Achilles tendon using burst vibrations. Methods: These vibrations, produced by a small vibration motor on the skin superficial to the tendon, are sensed by a skin-mounted accelerometer, which measures the tendon’s response to burst excitation under varying tensile load. In this study, twelve healthy subjects performed a variety of everyday tasks designed to expose the Achilles tendon to a range of loading conditions. To approximate the vibration motor-tendon system and provide an explanation for observed changes in tendon response, a 2-degree- of-freedom mechanical systems model was developed. Results: Reliable, characteristic changes in the burst response profile as a function of Achilles tendon tension were observed during all loading tasks. Using a machine learning-based approach, we developed a regression model capable of accurately estimating net ankle moment—which captures general trends in tendon tension—across a range of walking speeds and across subjects (R2 = 0.85). Simulated results of the mechanical model accurately recreated behaviors observed in vivo. Finally, preliminary, proof- of-concept results from a fully wearable system demonstrated trends similar to those observed in experiments conducted using benchtop equipment. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an untethered, unobtrusive system can effectively assess tendon loading during activities of daily life. Significance: Access to such a system would have broad implications for injury recovery and prevention, athletic training, and the study of human movement.

Traditional rigid exoskeletons can be challenging to perfectly align with a wearer’s biological joints and can have large inertias, which can lead to the wearer altering their natural motion patterns. Exosuits, in comparison, use textiles to create tensile forces over the body in parallel with the muscles, enabling them to be light and not restrict the wearer’s kinematics. We de- scribe the biologically inspired design and function of our exosuit, including a simpliﬁed model of the suit’s archi- tecture and its interaction with the body. A key feature of the exosuit is that it can generate forces passively due to the body’s motion, similar to the body’s ligaments and tendons. These passively-generated forces can be sup- plemented by actively contracting Bowden cables using geared electric motors, to create peak forces in the suit of up to 200N. We deﬁne the suit-human series stiffness as an important parameter in the design of the exosuit and measure it on several subjects, and we perform human subjects testing to determine the biomechanical and phys- iological effects of the suit. Results from a ﬁve-subject study showed a minimal effect on gait kinematics and an average best-case metabolic reduction of 6.4%, compar- ing suit worn unpowered vs powered, during loaded walk- ing with 34.6kg of carried mass including the exosuit and actuators (2.0kg on both legs, 10.1kg total).","id":"e0a80efa-5288-495f-8e98-556e1a10b401"}

Abstract Objective: To investigate the effects of an automated stride assistance device that assists hip joint ﬂexion and extension movement in energy expenditure during walking in healthy young adults using an expired gas method. Design: Prospective, single-group design to compare the differences of energy expenditure between 2 assistive conditions. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Healthy volunteers (NZ10) aged 21 to 32 years. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Oxygen consumption per unit time ( _VO2) cost (ml$kg1$m1), and heart rate (beats\/min) were measured in 2 assistive conditions (with 3-Nm hip motion assistance and without assistance) and at 2 walking speeds (comfortable walking speed [CWS] and maximum walking speed [MWS]). Results: There were no signiﬁcant differences in walking speed between the with- and without-assistance conditions at either the CWS or MWS. The _VO2 cost and heart rate were signiﬁcantly reduced in the with-assistance condition compared with the without-assistance condition, at both the CWS and MWS. The reduction in the _VO2 cost during the with-assistance condition, relative to the without-assistance condition, was 7.06% at the CWS and 10.52% at the MWS. Conclusions: The automated stride assistance device is useful for reducing energy expenditure during walking in healthy adults. Further studies are warranted to investigate if this device provides substantial help to individuals with impaired mobility as a result of strength deﬁcits.

The controller makes use of gravity compensation, feedforward movement assistance, and reinforcement of isometric joint torques to achieve assistance without dictating the spatiotemporal nature of joint movement. The patient is allowed to self-select walking speed and is able to make trajectory adaptations to maintain balance without interference from the controller. The governing equations and the finite state machine which comprise the system are described herein. The control architecture was implemented in a lower-limb exoskeleton and a preliminary experimental assessment was conducted in which a patient with hemiparesis resulting from stroke walked with assistance from the exoskeleton. The patient exhibited improvements in fast gait speed, step length asymmetry, and stride length in each session, as measured before and after exoskeleton training, presumably as a result of using the exoskeleton. I. INTRODUCTION Each year, approximately 800,000 people in the US suffer a stroke or cerebrovascular accident (CVA), of which approximately 200,000 survivors are affected by lower-extremity hemiparesis to an extent that prevents walking without assistance six months after [1, 2]. Typical gait deficits in lower-limb-affected post-stroke individuals involve a combination of impaired muscle strength, coordination and proprioception, and often excessive muscle tone in the paretic limb. The two most immediate biomechanical effects of these impairments are instability of the paretic leg during the stance phase of gait, and insufficient foot clearance on the paretic side during the swing phase of gait. Given these biomechanical deficits, the movement objectives of post-stroke gait training primarily entail improving load acceptance on the paretic leg during stance, and improving foot clearance of the paretic leg via increased hip and knee flexion in the paretic leg during swing. These objectives have traditionally been pursued by a combination of physiotherapy (e.g., mat exercises, weight training, use of fitness equipment) and assisted overground gait training. These may be supplemented with body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) or robotically assisted treadmill training. Various methods have been proposed to control the patient-robot interaction in robotically-assisted BWSTT systems [3-7]. Research supported by U.S","id":"622b1815-81bd-4087-b2a0-05ef81303a85"}

The movie also ignores the importance of designing for the wearer’s safety. In Atlas, the suit design unnecessarily complicates emergency medical procedures. During a fight sequence, Lopez is injured and must be removed from the suit to receive medical care, thereby exposing her to attack; ideally, these medical devices would be built into the roomy interior of the suit or incor- porated into the existing points of contact between her body and the suit. The only problem that might be satisfactorily solved is cost, because the military in Atlas appears to be working with an unlimited budget.  In the Atlas universe, roboticists have ap- parently spent those 20 years creating exo- suits that can walk by themselves, although, in reality, an exoskeleton walking with a hu- man inside is the harder problem. Since the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge in 2015, bipedal walking robots have become common. However, in the case of an exo- skeleton, the wearer magnifies the difficulty of self- stabilization; the suit must maintain its balance with a person whose unpredict- able and unmodeled upper body movements ripple across their deformable, fluid body, introducing perturbations into the control system. To cope with these perturbations, real- world lower- body exoskeletons for para- plegics typically expect the wearer to use crutches as an aid while walking and for someone to externally assist the user in standing up or sitting down. To Atlas’ credit, a suit would be feasible in 20 years, espe- cially given the 2023 Wandercraft demon- stration in New York City with Kevin Piette, a paraplegic for more than 10 years (3).

Collins and Rachel W. Jackson Department of Mechanical Engineering, Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213-3815 biomechatronics.cit.cmu.edu, stevecollins@cmu.edu  Abstract—Stroke leads to severe mobility impairments for millions of individuals each year. Functional outcomes can be improved through manual treadmill therapy, but high costs limit patient exposure and, thereby, outcomes. Robotic gait training could increase the viable duration and frequency of training sessions, but robotic approaches employed thus far have been less effective than manual therapy. These shortcomings may relate to subconscious energy-minimizing drives, which might cause patients to engage less actively in therapy when provided with corrective robotic assistance. We have devised a new method for gait rehabilitation that harnesses, rather than ﬁghts, least-effort tendencies. Therapeutic goals, such as increased use of the paretic limb, are made easier than the patient’s nominal gait through selective assistance from a robotic platform. We performed a pilot test on a healthy subject (N = 1) in which altered self-selected stride length was induced using a tethered robotic ankle-foot orthosis. The subject ﬁrst walked on a treadmill while wearing the orthosis with and without assistance at unaltered and voluntarily altered stride length. Voluntarily increasing stride length by 5% increased metabolic energy cost by 4%. Robotic assistance decreased energy cost at both unaltered and voluntarily increased stride lengths, by 6% and 8% respectively. We then performed a test in which the robotic system continually monitored stride the subject’s stride length and provided more assistance if length approached a target increase. This adaptive assistance protocol caused the subject to slowly adjust their gait patterns towards the target, leading to a 4% increase in stride length. Metabolic energy consumption was simultaneously reduced by 5%. These results suggest that selective-assistance protocols based on targets relevant to rehabilitation might lead patients to self- select desirable gait patterns during robotic gait training sessions, possibly facilitating better adherence and outcomes.

Based on the human-robot interaction force information, a PID control algorithm is applied to realize the passive following control of the swing phase. Aiming at the requirements of the active assist of the support phase on the joint angle and the size of the assist, a composite control method with PID control as the outer loop and sliding mode control as the inner loop is proposed. In order to solve the sliding mode vibration problem, the equivalent sliding mode control algorithm is used, and the sign function in it is replaced by the saturation function.

These methods vary from the simplest case of using solely commanded motor torques, to partial consideration of the robot dynamics, to advanced methods considering full robot dynamics such as inverse dynamics (ID) and nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) based algorithms. Dynamic and friction models of the exoskeleton were developed and their parameters were identified using an evolutionary optimization algorithm to ensure high parameter accuracy. When used with accurate model parameters, ID method led to 20 to 22% average error, while NDO method generated 12 to 18% average error, as evaluated in experiments with a force sensor. These values compare to average error values of up to 132% for using motor torques only, and between 25 to 69% when partial dynamics were used. A sensitivity analysis of the ID and NDO methods to inaccuracies in model parameter estimations revealed considerable sensitivity of these advanced methods to model parameter variations. A summary is provided for the typical estimation accuracy levels that can be expected of these methods and discuss the limitations and considerations that should be taken into account for their use.

This paper presents a torque controller for an ankle exoskeleton that uses state estimation with a data-driven kinematic model to continuously estimate the phase, phase rate, stride length, and ramp parameters during locomotion. The controller applies torque assistance based on the estimated phase and adapts the torque proﬁle based on the estimated task variables to match human torques observed in a multi-activity database of 10 able-bodied subjects. We demonstrate in silico that the controller yields phase estimates that are more accurate than state of the art, while also estimating task variables with compa- rable accuracy to recent machine learning approaches.

Thirty elderly adults (15 males\/ 15 females) participated in thispaper. The experimental pro- tocol consisted of overground gait at comfortable speed under three different conditions: free gait without robot assistance, robot-assisted gait with zero torque (RAG-Z), and full RAG. Under all conditions, muscle effort was analyzed using a 12-channel surface electromyography system. Spatio-temporal data were collected at 120 Hz using a 3-D motion capture system with six infrared cam- eras. Metabolic cost parameters were collected as oxygen consumptionperunit(ml\/min\/kg)andaerobicenergyexpen- diture (Kcal\/min). In the RAG condition,participantsdemon- stratedimprovedgaitfunction,decreasedmuscleeffort,and reduced metabolic cost. Although the hip assist robot only provides assistance at the hip joint, our results demon- strated a clear reduction in knee and ankle muscle activity in addition to decreased hip ﬂexor and extensor activity.

This study presents an exoskeleton that boosts vertical jumping—a fast, short movement during which the muscles are exerted at peak capacity. It was hypothesized that a passive exoskeleton would increase vertical jump height without requiring exter- nal energy input. The device comprises springs that work in parallel with the muscles of the quadriceps femoris. The springs store mechanical energy during knee ﬂexion (the negative work phase) and release that energy during the subsequent knee extension (the positive work phase), augmenting the muscles. Ten healthy participants were evaluatedin two experimental sessions. In the ﬁrst session, the participants jumped without receiving instructions on how to use the exoskeleton, and the results showed no dif- ference in jump height when jumping with the exoskeleton orjumpingwithoutit.Inthesecondsession,theparticipants were instructedto achievedeeperinitialsquatheightsat the start of the jump. This resultedin a 6.4% increasein average jump height compared to jumping without the exoskeleton (each participant performed ﬁve jumps for each the two conditions). This is the ﬁrst time that a passive exoskeleton has been shown to improve the height of a vertical jump from a dead stop.  Index Terms—Adaptation, augmentation, exoskeleton,  vertical jumping.  I.

Journal of Experimental Biology • Accepted manuscript  Summary statement  A soft robotic exosuit designed to assist the paretic limb during walking can induce more symmetrical body  center of mass power generation by the paretic and nonparetic limbs and reduce metabolic power  consumption during hemiparetic walking.  Abstract  Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically asymmetric and metabolically expensive. Weakness  and impaired control of the paretic ankle contribute to reduced forward propulsion and ground clearance—  walking subtasks critical for safe and efficient locomotion. Targeted gait interventions that improve paretic  ankle function after stroke are therefore warranted. We have developed textile-based, soft wearable robots  that transmit mechanical power generated by off-board or body-worn actuators to the paretic ankle using  Bowden cables (soft exosuits) and have demonstrated the exosuits can overcome deficits in paretic limb  forward propulsion and ground clearance, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking.  This study elucidates the biomechanical mechanisms underlying exosuit-induced reductions in metabolic  power. We evaluated the relationships between exosuit-induced changes in the body center of mass (COM)  power generated by each limb, individual joint powers, and metabolic power. Compared to walking with  an exosuit unpowered, exosuit assistance produced more symmetrical COM power generation during the  critical period of the step-to-step transition (22.4±6.4% more symmetric).

Quinlivan, Sangjun Lee, Philippe Malcolm, Denise M. Rossi, Christopher Siviy and Conor J. Walsh  Abstract Mobility can be limited due to age or impairments. Wearable robotics provide the chance to increase mobility and thus independence. A powered soft exosuit was designed that assist with both ankle plantarﬂexion and hip ﬂexion through a multi-articular suit architecture. So far, the best method to reduce meta- bolic cost of human walking with external forces is unknown. Two basic control strategies are compared in this study: an ankle moment inspired controller (AMIC) and an ankle positive power inspired controller (APIC). Both controllers provided a similar amount of average positive exosuit power and reduced the net metabolic cost of walking by 15 %. These results suggest that average positive power could be more important than assistive moment during single stance for reducing metabolic cost. Further analysis must show if one of the approaches has advantages for wearers comfort, changes in walking kinetics and kinematics, balance related biomechanics, or electrical energy consumption.

Traditional rigid exoskeletons can be challenging to perfectly align with a wearer’s biological joints and can have large inertias, which can lead to the wearer altering their natural motion patterns. Exosuits, in comparison, use textiles to create tensile forces over the body in parallel with the muscles, enabling them to be light and not restrict the wearer’s kinematics. We de- scribe the biologically inspired design and function of our exosuit, including a simpliﬁed model of the suit’s archi- tecture and its interaction with the body. A key feature of the exosuit is that it can generate forces passively due to the body’s motion, similar to the body’s ligaments and tendons. These passively-generated forces can be sup- plemented by actively contracting Bowden cables using geared electric motors, to create peak forces in the suit of up to 200N. We deﬁne the suit-human series stiffness as an important parameter in the design of the exosuit and measure it on several subjects, and we perform human subjects testing to determine the biomechanical and phys- iological effects of the suit. Results from a ﬁve-subject study showed a minimal effect on gait kinematics and an average best-case metabolic reduction of 6.4%, compar- ing suit worn unpowered vs powered, during loaded walk- ing with 34.6kg of carried mass including the exosuit and actuators (2.0kg on both legs, 10.1kg total).","id":"e0a80efa-5288-495f-8e98-556e1a10b401"}

In this study, we examined hip and knee joint kinetics during stair climbing in 35 young healthy subjects using a subject-speciﬁc knee model to estimate bone-on-bone tibiofemoral and patello-femoral joint contact forces. The net knee forces were below one body weight while the peak posterior–anterior contact force was close to one body weight. The peak distal–proximal contact force was on average 3 times body weight and could be as high as 6 times body weight. These contact forces occurred at a high degree of knee ﬂexion where there is a smaller joint contact area resulting in high contact stresses. The peak knee adduction moment was 0.42 (0.15) N m\/kg while the ﬂexion moment was 1.16 (0.24) N m\/kg. Similar peak moment values, but different curve proﬁles, were found for the hip. The hip and knee posterio-anterior shear forces and the knee ﬂexion moment were higher during stair climbing than during level walking. The most striking difference between stair ascent and level walking was that the peak patello-femoral contact force was 8 times higher during stair ascent. These data can be used as baseline measures in pathology studies, as input to theoretical joint models, and as input to mechanical joint simulators. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Lawson , Member, IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb , Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes the design, control, and preliminary assessment of a novel microprocessor- controlled multifunction ankle prosthesis that provides three microprocessor-controlled behaviors—a selectable stiffness equilibrium angle, lockable conformal damping, and swing-phase repositioning. Following a description of the motivation for providing these behaviors, the authors provide a detailed description of the device and walking controller design. This device utilizes a power-asymmetric linear actuator to provide the desired functionality in a com- pact and lightweight package through a combination of both hydraulic and electromechanical actuation approaches. The device is controlled for level ground walking via a ﬁnite- state machine. The functionality of the prosthesis is demon- strated by a set of benchtop experiments that characterize the ability of the prosthesis to provide the three desired be- haviors and by an experiment in which the prosthesis was worn by a transtibial amputee during walking. Both sets of experiments indicate that the prosthesis provides the func- tionality for which it was designed.  available at low to moderate cost. These prostheses generally work well for level walking and level-ground standing, but lack the adaptability to explicitly accommodate other terrain or lo- comotion activities, such as slope walking, slope standing, and stairambulation.Forexample, inastudyof226individuals with transtibial amputation [2], 88% could walk unassisted in their home and 76% could walk unassisted outside on level ground. Of the same cohort, however, only 48% could walk unassisted outside on uneven ground, and only 47% could walk unassisted down a few steps without a handrail. A number of other studies corroborate the substantial challenges of slope and stair walk- ing for individuals with lower extremity amputation [2]–[9]. Speciﬁcally, Burger et al. [4] report that approximately 17% of transtibial amputees avoid climbing stairs on a daily basis. Additionally, Koehler-McNicholas et al. [5] report that amputee subjects rated socket comfort for sloped walking as signiﬁcantly worse than that of level walking.  Index Terms—Amputation, ankle, biomechanics, control,  design, prostheses.

In such applications, the single-joint mustcoordinatemovementwith othernon-controlledjoints. The authors have previously proposed a multi-joint control method called a ﬂow controller, which provides several desirable characteristics for such assistance. In this paper, the authors adapt the fundamentally multi-joint ﬂow control approach to a system with a single actuated joint, but with multiple movement degrees of freedom. The single degree of actuation ﬂow control method was implemented on a representative system, speciﬁcally a knee exoskeleton that coordinates assistance with ipsilateral thigh move- ment during walking. The ability of the controller and knee exoskeleton to appropriately inﬂuence knee movement was evaluated in level walking experiments on three subjects with unilateral lower-limb impairment. Results show the device and controller provide improvements in knee move- ment in all subjects. Subjective feedback from the subjects indicates a high level of comfort with the controller.

Common causes of movement impairment include stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral palsy. Individuals who have movement impairment, but are still capable of ambulation, are herein referred to as poorly-ambulatory individuals. Poorly-ambulatory individuals’ leg movements are typically characterized by leg muscle weak- ness and potentially also by spastic muscle tone.

Using biomechanical locomotion data, we run a simple simulation of two types of exoskeletons: those that provide a parallel load-path to ground, and those that apply torque directly to the human knee joint. We ﬁnd that the second type offers larger reductions at normal walking speeds and that the power density required for knee load reduction is much lower than for metabolic cost reduction.

Recently, various types of wearable walking assist robots have been developed to improve gait function and metabolic efficiency for elderly adults. Several studies have shown that walking assist robots can improve cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during level walking in elderly. However, there is limited evidence demonstrating the effect of walking assist robots on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair walking in elderly adults. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the assistance effect of a newly developed wearable hip assist robot on cardiopulmonary metabolic efficiency during stair ascent in elderly adults. Methods: Fifteen healthy elderly adults participated. The Gait Enhancing Mechatronic System (GEMS), developed by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Korea, was used in the present study. The metabolic energy expenditure was measured using a K4b2 while participants performed randomly assigned two conditions consecutively: free ascending stairs without the GEMS or robot-assisted ascending stair with the GEMS.","id":"ce43dd8a-b515-47be-87ce-bd3d461548e4"}

Sawicki1,2,3*, Owen N. Beck1,2, Inseung Kang1 and Aaron J. Young1,3*  Abstract  Since the early 2000s, researchers have been trying to develop lower-limb exoskeletons that augment human mobility by reducing the metabolic cost of walking and running versus without a device. In 2013, researchers finally broke this ‘metabolic cost barrier’. We analyzed the literature through December 2019, and identified 23 studies that demonstrate exoskeleton designs that improved human walking and running economy beyond capable without a device. Here, we reviewed these studies and highlighted key innovations and techniques that enabled these devices to surpass the metabolic cost barrier and steadily improve user walking and running economy from 2013 to nearly 2020. These studies include, physiologically-informed targeting of lower-limb joints; use of off-board actuators to rapidly prototype exoskeleton controllers; mechatronic designs of both active and passive systems; and a renewed focus on human-exoskeleton interface design. Lastly, we highlight emerging trends that we anticipate will further augment wearable-device performance and pose the next grand challenges facing exoskeleton technology for augmenting human mobility.

McLain3, Inseung Kang1, and Aaron J. Young1  Abstract— The knee joint performs a significant amount of positive or negative mechanical work during gradient walking, and targeted assistance during periods of high mechanical work could yield strong human augmentation benefits. This paper explores the biomechanical effects of providing knee extension assistance during the early stance phase of the gait cycle using a powered unilateral knee exoskeleton during gradient walking on able-bodied subjects. Twelve subjects walked on 15% gradient incline and decline surfaces with the exoskeleton providing knee extension assistance during the early stance phase of the gait cycle. For both incline and decline walking, the exoskeleton assistance reduced the muscle activation of the knee extensors on the assisted leg (p < 0.05). However, only approximately half the individuals responded to exoskeleton assistance positively by reducing their metabolic cost of walking for both incline and decline tasks. The results indicate that, unlike the individuals who did respond, the individuals who did not respond to the assistance may have penalized their metabolic cost by their biomechanical compensatory behaviors from the unassisted leg.

This work aimed to investigate energetic adaptations occurring over multiple training sessions, while walking with a soft exosuit assisting the hip joint. The participants attended five training sessions within 20 days. They walked carrying a load of 20.4 kg for 20 minutes with the exosuit powered and five minutes with the exosuit unpowered. Percentage change in net metabolic cost between the powered and unpowered conditions improved across sessions from −6.2 ± 3.9% (session one) to −10.3 ± 4.7% (session five), indicating a significant effect associated with training. The percentage change at session three (−10.5 ± 4.5%) was similar to the percentage change at session five, indicating that two 20-minute sessions may be sufficient for users to fully adapt and maximize the metabolic benefit provided by the exoskeleton. Retention was also tested measuring the metabolic reduction five months after the last training session. The percent change in metabolic cost during this session (−10.1 ± 3.2%) was similar to the last training session, indicating that the adaptations resulting in reduced metabolic cost are preserved. These outcomes are relevant when evaluating exoskeletons’ performance on naïve users, with a specific focus on hip extension assistance.","id":"f32f524b-bd38-4716-9ff9-9630395f0810"}

Real-time gait event detec- tion is executed with an inertial measurement unit based on an onboard trained model. Two models are trained based on the collected data from the knee exoskeleton at normal walk- ing speed under zero torque and assistive torque control modes, respectively. We conduct two experiments: 1) real-time detec- tion experiments under zero torque control at different speeds and 2) real-time detection and assistive torque control experi- ments based on real-time detection results at different speeds. Five able-bodied subjects participated in the experiments. The recognition accuracy and assistive torque performances based on real-time detection are evaluated. The experimental results show that all the critical gait events are detected rightly and the delay of gait event detection does not lead to damage to the overall system of knee exoskeleton. In addition, in real-time detection and assistive torque control experiments, parameters of the con- troller are refreshed for the current cycle based on the previous gait cycle, which is reasonable according to the detection result. The tracking performance of the torque could meet the require- ment. This paper provides a feasible and applicable method for knee exoskeleton control based on real-time gait event detection.

Although some studies have studied the effects of using rehabilitation exoskeletons for patients rehabilitation, the improvement of patient gait quality with a single knee exoskeleton has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, a deep neural network-based biological torque controller is presented for real-time control of the unilateral knee exoskeleton. The aim was to improve the gait quality of patients by enhancing their gait symmetry. A lightweight unilateral knee exoskeleton system with low passive impedance and well transparent was used to develop and validate the controller during both treadmill and level walking modes. The proposed control strategy is characterized by accurate assisted output torque even when the motion pattern is changed, and does not require controller parameter adjustment. To test it, five able-bodied subjects used an exoskeleton with an artificial blocking device at the knee joint position that simulated the patient ’ s defective postoperative pathological gait( i.e., reduced knee flexion). The subjects walked continuously on a treadmill and a flat surface. The experimental results demonstrated that the control strategy effectively improved the gait quality of the participants.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Powered knee and ankle prosthesis with indirect volitional swing control enables level-ground walking and crossing over obstacles Joel Mendez, Sarah Hood, Andy Gunnel, Tommaso Lenzi*  Powered prostheses aim to mimic the missing biological limb with controllers that are finely tuned to replicate the nominal gait pattern of non-amputee individuals. Unfortunately, this control approach poses a problem with real-world ambulation, which includes tasks such as crossing over obstacles, where the prosthesis trajectory must be modified to provide adequate foot clearance and ensure timely foot placement. Here, we show an indirect volitional control approach that enables prosthesis users to walk at different speeds while smoothly and continuously crossing over obstacles of different sizes without explicit classification of the environment. At the high level, the proposed controller relies on a heuristic algorithm to continuously change the maximum knee flexion angle and the swing duration in harmony with the user’s residual limb. At the low level, minimum-jerk planning is used to continuously adapt the swing trajectory while maximizing smoothness. Experiments with three individuals with above-knee amputation show that the proposed control approach allows for volitional control of foot clearance, which is necessary to negotiate environmental barriers. Our study suggests that a powered prosthesis controller with intrinsic, volitional adaptability may provide prosthesis users with functionality that is not currently available, facilitating real-world ambulation.","id":"84d1eb26-eccb-4869-b25c-7d7a013b0007"}

Kang4, Vito Monaco1, Silvestro Micera1,5 and Sunil K. Agrawal2*  Abstract  Background: Damage to the cerebellum can affect neural structures involved in locomotion, causing gait and balance disorders. However, the integrity of cerebellum does not seem to be critical in managing sudden and unexpected environmental changes such as disturbances during walking. The cerebellum also plays a functional role in motor learning. Only a few effective therapies exist for individuals with cerebellar ataxia. With these in mind, we aimed at investigating: (1) corrective response of participants with cerebellar ataxia (CA) to unexpected gait perturbations; and (2) the effectiveness of a perturbation-based training to improve their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady walking. Specifically, we hypothesized that: (1) CA group can show a corrective behavior similar to that of a healthy control group; (2) the exposure to a perturbation-based treatment can exploit residual learning capability, thus improving their dynamic stability during balance recovery responses and steady locomotion.  Methods: Ten participants with cerebellar ataxia and eight age-matched healthy adults were exposed to a single perturbation-based training session. The Active Tethered Pelvic Assist Device applied unexpected waist-pull perturbations while participants walked on a treadmill. Spatio-temporal parameters and dynamic stability were determined during corrective responses and steady locomotion, before and after the training. The ANalysis Of VAriance was the main statistical test used to assess the effects of group (healthy vs CA) and training (baseline vs post) on spatio-temporal parameters of the gait and margin of stability.  Results: Data analysis revealed that individuals with cerebellar ataxia behaved differently from healthy volunteers: (1) they retained a wider base of support during corrective responses and steady gait both before and after the training; (2) due to the training, patients improved their anterior-posterior margin of stability during steady walking only.","id":"dcdb368b-a1ba-483a-9463-3a0f21c6ec74"}

This sense is known as proprio- ception and is essential to human motor control. Although there have been many attempts to create human- mechatronic interactions, there is still no robust, repeatable methodology to reflect proprioceptive information from a synthetic device onto the nervous system. To address this shortcoming, we present an agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI). The AMI is composed of (i) a surgical construct made up of two muscle-tendons—an agonist and an antagonist—surgically connected in series so that contraction of one muscle stretches the other and (ii) a bidirectional efferent-afferent neural control architecture. The AMI preserves the dynamic muscle rela- tionships that exist within native anatomy, thereby allowing proprioceptive signals from mechanoreceptors within both muscles to be communicated to the central nervous system. We surgically constructed two AMIs within the residual limb of a subject with a transtibial amputation. Each AMI sends control signals to one joint of a two-degree- of-freedom ankle-foot prosthesis and provides proprioceptive information pertaining to the movement of that joint. The AMI subject displayed improved control over the prosthesis compared to a group of four subjects having traditional amputation. We also show natural reflexive behaviors during stair ambulation in the AMI subject that do not appear in the cohort of subjects with traditional amputation. In addition, we demonstrate a system for closed-loop joint torque control in AMI subjects. These results provide a framework for integrating bionic systems with human physiology.","id":"afd15bb6-5009-4e7f-8209-704f4a72eca3"}

Lerner  Abstract—The high energy cost of walking in individuals with cerebralpalsy (CP) contributessigniﬁcantlyto reduced mobility and quality of life. The purpose of this paper was to develop and clinically evaluate an untethered ankle exoskeleton with the ability to reduce the metabolic cost of walking in children and young adults with gait pathology from CP. We designed a battery-powered device consisting of an actuator-and-control module worn above the waist with a Bowden cable transmission used to provide torque to pulleys aligned with the ankle. Special consideration was made to minimize adding mass to the body, particu- larly distal portions of the lower-extremity. The exoskeleton provided plantar-ﬂexor assistance during the mid-to-late stance phase, controlledusing a real-time control algorithm and embedded sensors. We conducted a device feasibility and a pilot clinical evaluation study with ﬁve individuals with CP ages ﬁve through thirty years old. Participants completed an average of 130 min of exoskeleton-assisted walking practice. We observed a 19 ± 5% improvement in the metabolic cost of transport (p = 0.011) during walking with untethered exoskeleton assistance compared to how participants walked normally.

Murray 神经肌肉障碍 步态辅助 外骨骼控制策略","content":" Abstract— The authors intend to utilize a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance in individuals with lower limb neuromuscular deficit. The authors suggest that two foundational elements are required to do so effectively. First, the exoskeleton system must be capable of reliable real-time gait phase detection, in order to determine the nature of gait assistance to provide. Second, in gait phases or circumstances in which the exoskeleton provides minimal assistance, the passive dynamics of the exoskeleton should not hinder the individual (i.e., should have the capability to minimally interfere with gait dynamics). As such, the exoskeleton system should be capable of actively compensating for its passive dynamics, namely the inertial, gravitational, and frictional effects it imposes on the user. This paper describes the implementation of these two foundational elements (real-time gait phase detection and active cancellation of passive dynamics) on a prototype lower limb exoskeleton, and provides experimental data demonstrating their respective efficacy. I. INTRODUCTION A number of neuromuscular impairments result in acute and\/or chronic locomotor deficits. Common conditions resulting in gait deficit or impairment include incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy (CP), multiple sclerosis (MS), and complications resulting from cerebral vascular accident (stroke). There are approximately 260,000 persons in the US with SCI, approximately one half of which are incomplete injuries [1]; there are approximately 765,000 individuals in the US with CP [2]; and there are approximately 350,000 individuals in the US with MS [3]. Collectively, there are approximately 1.3 million persons in the US living with one of these conditions. Further, there are approximately 7 million persons living in the US who have experienced a cerebral vascular accident (stroke) [4], and a significant portion of these have or have had gait impairment as a result. The authors are developing a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance in individuals with lower limb neuromuscular deficit, such as individuals in those populations previously cited. Some work has been performed on treadmill and over-ground robotic devices, and their control strategies have been characterized [5, 6]. In order to use a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance, two foundational capabilities must exist.

Using biomechanical locomotion data, we run a simple simulation of two types of exoskeletons: those that provide a parallel load-path to ground, and those that apply torque directly to the human knee joint.

Exerc. Sport Sci. Rev., Vol. 47, No. 4, pp. 237–245, 2019. Exoskeletons that improve locomotion economy typically are engineered to reduce users’ limb joint mechanical work or moments. Yet, limb joint dynamics do not necessarily reflect muscle dynamics, which dictate whole-body metabolic energy expenditure. Here, we hypothesize that exoskeletons primarily reduce user metabolic energy expenditure across locomotion conditions by reducing active muscle volume. Key Words: energetics, metabolism, augment, locomotion, performance, biomechanics, assistive device  Key Points   Center of mass, limb joint, and muscle mechanical do not explain well how exoskeletons alter locomotion economy.  Limb joint dynamics do not necessarily reflect the underly-  ing muscle dynamics across locomotion conditions.   Active muscles are the primary drivers of whole-body meta- bolic energy expenditure duringlocomotion. Consequently, exoskeletons likely needto consider muscle dynamicstoop- timize locomotion economy.   During walking and hopping with an exoskeleton, muscle force generation is a better correlate to locomotion economy than previously measured mechanical work parameters.  Tracking muscle length changes in vivo may help provide reasonably accurate active muscle volume calculations.  Future exoskeleton controllers may incorporate real-time muscle physiology measures to update device characteristics and maintain minimal active muscle volume and metabolic energy expenditure across locomotion conditions.","id":"1d84fff9-757b-4f69-809f-ada925b3edd7"}

The modular actuator of the orthosis is designed with a torque dense motor and a custom low-ratio transmission (24:1) to provide mechanical transparency to the user, allowing them to actively contribute to their joint kinematics during gait training. The 4.88 kg orthosis utilizes frameless components and light materials, such as aluminum alloy and carbon ﬁber, to reduce its mass. A human subject experiment demonstrates accurate torque control with high output torque during stance and low backdrive torque during swing at fast walking speeds. This work shows that backdrivability, precise torque control, high torque output, and light weight can be achieved in a powered orthosis without the high cost and complexity of variable transmissions, clutches, and\/or series elastic components.  I. INTRODUCTION  Physical training is often needed for patients to relearn how to walk after a stroke [1]–[3].

To address this, researchers are investigating powered lower-limb rehabilitation orthoses to relieve the repetitive and physically tasking duties of therapists as well as to improve patient recovery efﬁcacy [4].

While others have shown positive results, the fundamental question of how the exoskeleton interacts with the human remains unknown. Understanding the optimal as- sistance magnitude is not simply relevant for control, it is a critical knowledge for exoskeleton designers. An accurate understanding of assistance levels will enable the designers to minimize exoskele- ton mass and improve the performance by avoiding excessive ac- tuators and drivetrains. We explored the relationship between the assistance magnitude and the energetic cost beneﬁts by using a series elastic actuator driven powered hip exoskeleton. The ex- oskeleton controller mimics a human biological hip moment to provide the assistance during the gait cycle. Ten able-bodied subjects walked using the exoskeleton with different magnitudes of assistance in both hip ﬂexion and extension. Generally, the result- ing metabolic cost across different assistance conditions showed a U-shape trend which was consistent across all subjects (p < 0.01).

Humans can generate diverse locomotion behaviors through the hierarchical control of the supraspinal and the spinal systems, where the spinal control is often assumed to consist of central pattern generators and reﬂexes. It has been demonstrated through simulation that human walking and running can be generated with control models where the central pattern generator is controlled in a hierarchical structure. How- ever, no reﬂex control model in such framework has been proposed. Here we propose that locomotion behaviors can be controlled by a hierarchical control structure where the supraspinal system modulates reﬂexes with simple signals. We demonstrate in physics simulation that a simple neu- romuscular model with a hierarchical reﬂex control can regulate running speed and height on unknown terrains with height diﬀerences of ±10cm.  1  Introduction  Humans exhibit agile locomotion behaviors such as altering the locomotion speed and jumping over obstacles as needed. It is widely recognized that such behaviors are realized through a hierarchical control structure consisting of the supraspinal and the spinal control layer [1]. Spinal locomotion of decerebrated cats [2] and other vertebrates [3,4] demonstrates that large part of the control of normal locomotion is conducted in the spinal cord. To intentionally control locomotion behaviors based on environmental cues, it is necessary to modulate the spinal control through the supraspinal system. Therefore, understanding the mecha- nism of the spinal control and how it interacts with the supraspinal control is essential for explaining how legged locomotion is governed in biological systems. Diﬀerent types of human neuromuscular control models have demonstrated stable bipedal locomotion in physics simulation [5–8]. In a previous study, we have shown with a 3D human neuromuscular model that a reﬂex-based spinal control can generate diverse locomotion behaviors, including walking and run- ning, slope and stair negotiation, and deliberate obstacle avoidance [8]. Each be- havior has been generated with diﬀerent set of spinal control parameters, leaving unexplained how the diﬀerent sets can be stored and selected by the supraspinal system. In this study, we explore a simple solution of building a lookup table by mapping, in prior, all relevant states and control parameter sets. To this end,","id":"a8b18d4c-f3d1-4f81-9a54-11215bea7696"}

In this paper, the performance of a piezoelectric energy harvester embedded within custom-designed knee implant in powering RF transmitter was evaluated through simulations. This power harvester is composed of four piezoelectric generators along with four off-the-shelf power conditioning circuits. It can har- vest electric power from dynamic forces dissipated inside knee implant during walking. The results demonstrate the possibility to deliver a constant electric power of 59.4mW during a simu- lated walking cycle. This conditioned power can operate an off- the-shelf ultra-low power RF transmitter. This may eliminate the need for rechargeable batteries to power instrumented knee implants. The proposed piezoelectric generator along with the ultra-miniature power conditioning and telemetry circuits may be integrated within the knee implant without increasing its physical size or changing its geometrical shape signiﬁcantly with respect to the conventional one. Therefore, its dynamic functionality and mechanical longevity may not be affected.  I. INTRODUCTION  or surgical preventive actions may be considered before damaging the implant to an extent where revision surgery is unavoidable. The preventive actions may include changes in patient’s lifestyle to avoid overloading the implant during weight-bearing athletic activities, physical therapy or even non-invasive or minimally-invasive surgical intervention. The need for revision surgery in order to replace damaged knee implants may then be reduced.  The telemetric system embedded into instrumented im- plants needs electric power to function during the in-vivo monitoring of tibiofemoral force distribution. This system can be powered by either externally via inductive coupling [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] or internally through an integrated power harvesting system. For the externally-powered sys- tems, the power transfer efﬁciency depends on the coil parameters, geometries and alignments in addition to the mutual distance between the external coil located outside the body (transmitter) and the internal coil integrated into the knee implant (receiver) [11].","id":"2f65749c-7ef4-4196-8fb4-69bd06e791ca"}

However, the performance of traditional deep learning mod- els is limited by the depth of networks, which is directly related to the training consumption. In addition, the pa- rameters of networks can only be updated by retraining when faced with newly acquired data. To address the above problems, an incremental learning method based on a tem- poral cascade broad learning system (TCBLS) is proposed for the RUL prediction of machinery with newly acquired data. Speciﬁcally, linear and nonlinear feature information is ﬁrst learned by the TCBLS. The ridge regression method is developed to calculate the weights of the network and establish an end-to-end mapping between the feature in- formation layer and the prediction layer. Finally, the incre- mental learning of new data and the incremental learning of nodes are proposed for adaptively updating the weights of the network in the face of newly acquired data and insufﬁcient prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is veriﬁed by four run-to-failure datasets. The comparison results with classical deep learning mod- els show that the proposed method is promising for RUL prediction as it achieves high prediction accuracy while saving training time consumption across orders of magni- tude and effectively handling newly acquired data without retraining.

It senses and monitors the delivered force and power of the exoskeleton for motion control and taking urgent safety action. Two FSR (force-sensitive resistors) sensors are used to measure the assistance force when the user is walking. The sensor system directly measures the interaction force between the exoskeleton and the lower limb of the user instead of a previously reported force-sensing method, which estimated the hip assistance force from the current of the motor and lookup tables. Furthermore, the sensor system has the advantage of generating torque in the walking-assistant actuator based on directly measuring the hip-assistance force. Thus, the gait-assistance exoskeleton system can control the delivered power and torque to the user. The force sensing structure is designed to decouple the force caused by hip motion from other directional forces to the sensor so as to only measure that force. We conﬁrmed that the hip-assistance force could be measured with the proposed prototype compact force sensor attached to a thigh frame through an experiment with a real system.

BLS has attracted increasing attention from many scholars owing to its excellent performance. This article proposes a weighted BLS (WBLS) based on BLS to tackle the noise and outliers in an industrial process. WBLS provides a uniﬁed framework for easily using different methods of calculating the weighted penalty factor. Using the weighted penalty factor to constrain the contribution of each sample to modeling, the normal and abnormal samples were allocated higher and lower weights to increase and decrease their contributions, respectively. Hence, the WBLS can eliminate the bad effect of noise and outliers  on the modeling. The weighted ridge regression algorithm is used to compute the algorithm solution. Weighted incremental learning algorithms are also developed using the weighted penalty factor to tackle the noise and outliers in the additional samples and quickly increase nodes or samples without retraining. The proposed weighted incremental learning algorithms provide a uniﬁed framework for using different methods of computing weights. We test the feasibility of the proposed algorithms on some public data sets and a real-world application. Experiment results show that our method has better generalization and robustness.","id":"11d16328-a924-4a75-8d1c-7dff2ea56541"}

First, the hardware design of the exoskeleton is presented, including the mechanical structure, actuator design and conﬁguration, and electronic system. Based on the nonlinear characteristics of human muscles, a nonlinear variable stiffness actuator (NLVSA) is designed for the actuation system of the exoskeleton. Next, the modeling of the NLVSA is described. In addition, an adaptive admittance control strategy comprising a spar- row search optimization algorithm-based long short-term memory neural network model and an adaptive admittance control algorithm based on the radial basis function neural network (RBFAAC) is proposed for the exoskeleton. Finally, a pilot study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the robotic knee exoskeleton. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the designed NLVSA, and the exoskeleton has the potential for human knee rehabilitation by providing effective assistance with the proposed control strategy. With the proposed RBFAAC algorithm, the average root mean square error between the reference and actual knee joint angles is 1.24° at different walking speeds.

INTRODUCTION  N OWADAYS, the motor function damage of a human knee  joint caused by a stroke, spinal cord injury, osteoarthritis, and other related diseases often occurs [1], [2], which makes it difﬁcult for individuals with muscle weakness or paralysis to perform activities of daily living [3]. Medical investigation demonstrates that lower limb motor function can be gradually improved by timely and repetitive rehabilitation training in indi- viduals with gait disorders [1], [4]. Therefore, medical devices such as robotic knee exoskeletons that can enable individuals with knee joint impairments to regain the ability to walk with a normal gait and, hence, to enhance their independence and well-being are desirable [5].","id":"fb3cc4a3-4d39-4a79-86cb-f9e51b67700c"}

Since the energy supplied by the proposed EMG is discontinuous in time, a tailored energy management circuit is necessary to adapt the harvested energy to the load energy requirements. The electromechanical generator is composed by two series of NdFeB magnets positioned into each condyle and a coil, placed in the pin of the tibial insert, which collects the magnetic flux variations, generated by the knee movements. A total knee replacement (TKR) prototype has been developed and realized in order to reproduce the knee mechanics. Therefore, electrical performances have been evaluated, at the first, measuring the EMG open circuit voltage by means of a high impedance buffer amplifier, and, subsequently, connecting the EMG to the energy management circuit able to manage the produced energy and to power an implanted circuit for force measurement inside the human knee. The tests showed that the EHS is able to supply the measuring circuit guaranteeing a tension between 2.45 V and 2.15 V for 25 ms almost every 1.5 s with a walking velocity of 1 Hz. The tests successfully demonstrate the possibility to power a measurement circuit transmitting the measurement data outside the prosthesis every about one-step and half.

Rouse1,2*  User preference is a promising objective for the control of robotic exoskeletons because it may capture the multi- factorial nature of exoskeleton use. However, to use it, we must first understand its characteristics in the context of exoskeleton control. Here, we systematically measured the control preferences of individuals wearing bilateral ankle exoskeletons during walking. We investigated users’ repeatability identifying their preferences and how preference changes with walking speed, device exposure, and between individuals with different technical back- grounds. Twelve naive and 12 knowledgeable nondisabled participants identified their preferred assistance in repeated trials by simultaneously self-tuning the magnitude and timing of peak torque. They were blinded to the control parameters and relied solely on their perception of the assistance to guide their tuning. We found that participants’ preferences ranged from 7.9 to 19.4 newton-meters and 54.1 to 59.2 percent of the gait cycle. Across trials, participants repeatably identified their preferences with a mean standard deviation of 1.7 newton-meters and 1.5 percent of the gait cycle. Within a trial, participants converged on their preference in 105 seconds. As the experiment progressed, naive users preferred higher torque magnitude. At faster walking speeds, these individuals were more precise at identifying the magnitude of their preferred assistance. Knowledgeable users preferred higher torque than naive users. These results highlight that although preference is a dynamic quantity, individuals can reliably identify their preferences. This work motivates strategies for the control of lower limb exoskeletons in which individuals customize assistance according to their unique preferences and provides meaningful insight into how users interact with exoskeletons.","id":"2ffb475d-4769-4e52-b545-50d6ae6b05b2"}

Controllers that vary knee swing speed have been shown to restore gait symmetry with a powered knee and ankle prosthesis. This study  was to combine an existing variable speed knee swing controller with an existing impedance stance controller to determine if comfortable walking with variable cadence can be achieved and if the control method transitions would be noticeable to the user. The knee swing trajectory and duration was varied based on user walking speed as a function of the previous stance phase duration. Four transfemoral amputations were fit with a powered knee and ankle prosthesis. After 3045 minutes of practice walking with the variable knee swing controller, subjects performed a variable speed walk test, a steady state walk test, and a 10-meter walk test. A GAITRite mat was used to collect spatial and temporal walking parameters during the 10-meter walk test. Results showed that subjects could control prosthetic knee swing duration and kinematics by modifying their walking speed. Subjects were able to comfortably transition between speeds and achieve mean (SD) comfortable and fast speeds of 1.10 (0.05) and 1.51 (0.05) m\/s, respectively for a 10-meter walk test.  contribution is to show that a variable speed knee controller can be combined with an impedance-based controller while maintaining the functionality of both controllers and to provide gait mechanics for amputee powered gait that can be used towards future studies of controller development and prosthesis design.  individuals with unilateral  I.

To identify the correct timing of giving assistive torques during the stair climbing process, integrating with a lower limb dynamic model with the foot-force measured data is a common way to derive the knee joint torque profile for gait analysis. However, this estimation method which requires the installation of pressure sensors on the sole of the feet has drawbacks including the inconvenience of exoskeleton wearing and increased moving difficulty. The fact that stair climbing is a sequential movement thus allows us to apply a recurrent neural network to obtain the relationship between the knee joint muscular torque and lower limb gait. Stair climbing experiments on a knee exoskeleton wearer reveal that the trained neural network is able to perform the desired knee joint torque estimation whose results can be applied to derive proper assistive torques in the presence of human-robot interaction.","id":"8dfa97e9-f028-4a1a-9c5a-e65c8308972f"}

When we’re young, we often role-play and pretend we have superpowers. Inspired by these experiences, we started working on what we refer to as superhuman sports, focusing on how we might make some of these powers a reality.  We want to create an application area to explore human augmenta- tion and enhance human abilities in a playful way. The field of superhu- man sports combines competition and physical elements from traditional sports with technology to overcome the somatic and spatial limitations of our human bodies. The field serves as a fascinating application area for human augmentation.  Toward SuPErhuman SPorTS Science—in particular, information technology—is already an integral part of today’s sports training and events. However, traditional sports emphasize the achievements of the individual. Sport federations and competitions struggle when it comes to knowing how to deal with the augmented human concept.  Consider, for example, Markus Rehm, an amputated long jumper with a  prosthetic right leg. He uses a blade-type leg prosthesis when competing. In 2014, he qualified for the European Champi- onships but wasn’t allowed to compete,1 because his prosthesis was viewed as a violation of the rules, even though it hasn’t been proven that the prosthesis gives him a natural advantage; other athletes with similar prostheses didn’t perform so well.2 This illustrates the current direction and challenges of allowing augmented humans to partici- pate in conventional sports.  In contrast, superhuman sports aim to create a field where people compete, overcoming technological—rather than solely human—limitations. The focus is on improving cognitive and physical functions of the human body, creating artificial senses and reflexes to partici- pate in sports competitions. We want to create and explore new experiences with these novel senses and reflexes by augmenting old sports and designing new ones, enhancing sports training, and sharing the experiences with both local and remote audience members.","id":"6b0e90c4-7728-4da2-ad11-8e5727e845a7"}

Walsha,b,∗  aBiodesign Lab, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA bThe Wyss Institute for Biologically-Inspired Engineering, Cambridge, MA, USA  Abstract  Exoskeletons comprised of rigid load-bearing structures have been developed for many years, but a new paradigm is to create “exosuits” that apply tensile forces to the body using textiles and utilize the bodys skeletal structure to support compressive forces. Exosuits are intended to augment the musculature by providing small to moderate levels of assistance at appropriate times in the walking cycle. They have a number of substantial beneﬁts: with their fabric construction, exosuits eliminate problems of needing to align a rigid frame precisely with the biological joints and their inertia can be extremely low. In this paper, we present a fully portable hip-assistance exosuit that uses a backpack frame to attach to the torso, onto which is mounted a spooled-webbing actuator that connects to the back of the users thigh. The actuators, powered by a geared brushless motor connected to a spool via a timing belt, wind up seat-belt webbing onto the spool so that a large travel is possible with a simple, compact mechanism. Designed to be worn over the clothing, the webbing creates a large moment arm around the hip that provides torques in the sagittal plane of up to 30% of the nominal biological torques for level-ground walking. Due to its soft design, the system does not restrict the motion of the hip in the ab- and adduction directions or rotation about the leg axis. Here we present the design of the system along with some initial measurements of the system in use during walking on level ground at 1.25 m\/s, where it creates a force of up to 150 N on the thigh, equivalent to a torque of 20.5 Nm to assist hip extension.

Nowadays, the proper alignment of knee mechanical axis and the perfect equalization of ﬂexion and extension gaps are ensured by computer-assisted TKA (CATKA). Nevertheless, any residual im- balance of collateral ligaments at the time of surgery can lead to an excessive imbalance in the postoperative period during the weight- bearing activities, which subject the knee collateral ligaments to increased loading. This in turn leads to an accelerated polyethylene wear, and consequently, to early failure of TKA. The instrumented tibialimplantproposedinthisstudycanpostoperativelyassessand monitor the progression of residual postoperative ligament imbal- ance of a prosthetic knee, which is perfectly aligned during the surgery thanks to CATKA, via a center-of-pressure (COP)-based approach. This approach depends on the measurement of relative displacementofCOPpositionduringthepostoperativeperiodwith respect to a reference position recorded at the beginning of this pe- riod. This measurement is performed for six predetermined ﬂexion angles representative of an entire gait cycle. The tibial implant can also generate the electrical power in addition to their role in mon- itoring the COP position thanks to the piezoceramics embedded within the tibial tray to achieve this twofold task.

The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations that takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. To emulate the adaptation skill of as- sisted human gait, human-robot interactive dynamics should be considered during optimization procedures. Most previous studies have only considered the normal gait for healthy people [5] and also they have not considered the human- robot interaction [6].  I. INTRODUCTION  Pathological gait patterns are observed in patients or elderly with gait disorders. For example, steppage gait occurs as a result of trying to compensate for the weakened ankle dorsiﬂexion. This compensation strategy with excessively ﬂexed hip and knee joints is used to clear the foot from the ground. Staggering gait occurs in post-stroke patients due imbalance caused from paretic limb.  Because their gait patterns are clearly different from a normal gait pattern. When using a robotic exoskeleton to assist their walking, they need a personalized assist pat- tern that is customized speciﬁc to their walking pattern to minimize mismatched assistive forces. When adjusting the control parameters for the assist pattern, the use of brute force search should be minimal to save time and effort. Gait simulation based approach can be a good alternative to provide assistance strategy guidelines for different gait types.","id":"48cdb2d4-9429-4a1a-9cfd-9bb81c7c55a1"}

Young, Anirban Mazumdar  Abstract—New human-centric approaches to safety can combine over-head camera views with situational awareness tools to enable humans to avoid rapidly evolving threats such as moving machines or falling debris. This paper explores how 360⁰ information can be used to inform humans of potential collisions. Specifically, we quantify how different individual (tactile, audio, and visual) and combined cue modalities affect failure rates and reaction times. Human-subject experiments were conducted in a custom virtual reality environment that simulates objects rapidly moving toward the subject. In order to successfully perform their task, the human subject must physically move their body out of the path of the moving threat before a collision occurs. This exploration of full-body physical response differentiates from previous related studies. The results of the 18-subject study provide quantified data on a range of cues and cue combinations. The study quantified failure rates and reaction times as a function of index of difficulty (Fitt’s Law) and threat directionality. The results confirm the hypothesis that the addition of tactile cues improve performance compared to non-tactile statistically cues with regards to failure rate and reaction time. This demonstrates how sensory cues can improve human physical response to rapid threats.  this work  Index Terms—tactile feedback, situational awareness, virtual  reality, sensory augmentation, human-machine communication.

Rouse, and Robert D. Gregg  Abstract—Most impedance-based walking controllers use a ﬁ- nite state machine (FSM) with dozens of user-speciﬁc parameters that need to be manually tuned by technical experts. These parameters are only optimal near the task (e.g., walking speed and incline) at which they were tuned, resulting in decreased per- formance as task inevitably varies. This paper presents a tuning- free, phase-based controller that uses a hybrid combination of continuously-variable impedance control during stance and kine- matic control during swing to enable biomimetic locomotion over a continuum of tasks. After generating a data-driven model of variable joint impedance with convex optimization, we implement a novel task-invariant phase variable and real-time estimates of speed and incline to enable the controller to autonomously adapt to task variation. Experiments with an amputee participant using a powered knee-ankle prosthesis show that our tuning- free controller 1) features highly-linear phase estimates and accurate task estimates, 2) produces more biomimetic joint work trends compared to a hand-tuned FSM impedance controller, and 3) achieves lower kinematic and kinetic error than the FSM impedance controller in 7 of 8 tested metrics. Our data-driven control approach may allow easier clinical implementation of variable-activity powered knee-ankle prostheses by replicating biological behavior across tasks without expert tuning.

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance. The proposed walking assistance device has reduced metabolic energy consumption by 13.2±4% compared with a free condition. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past two decades, many exoskeletons have been developed to perform tasks such as lifting heavy loads, aiding in the rehabilitation of patients in hospitals, and so on. More recently, they have been adapted for the elderly and the infirm . Use of these devices for assistance in walking or mobility enables such people to lead more active and independent lives. Many researchers have attempted to reduce the metabolic energy consumption as a performance measure.

Traditionally, collection of kinetics is mostly lim- ited to the lab environment because it relies on data that are measured from a motion capture system and ﬂoor- embedded force plates to calculate the dynamics via mus- culoskeletal models. This spatially limited method makes it extremely challenging to measure kinetics outside the laboratory in a variety of walking conditions due to the expensive device setup and large space required. Recently, employing machine learning with IMU sensors are sug- gested as an alternative method for biomechanical analy- ses. Although these methods enable estimating human ki- netic data outside the laboratory by linking IMU sensor data with kinetics dataset, they are limited to show inaccurate kinetic estimates even in highly repeatable single walking conditions due to the employment of generic deep learn- ing algorithms. Thus, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model, Kinetics-FM-DLR-Ensemble-Net for single limb prediction of hip, knee, and ankle joint moments and 3-dimensional GRFs using three IMU sensors on the thigh, shank, and foot under several representatives walking con- ditions in daily living, such as treadmill, level-ground, stair, and ramp. This is the ﬁrst study that implements both joint moments and GRFs in multiple walking conditions using IMU sensors via deep learning. Our deep learning model is versatile and accurate for identifying human kinetics across diverse subjects and walking conditions and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning model for kinetics estimation by a large margin.

Emerging automatic tuning algorithms have shown promise to ease the device personalization procedure. However, very few automatic tuning algorithms consider the user preference as the tuning goal, which may limit the adoptability of the robotic prosthesis. In this study, we propose and evaluate a novel prosthesis control tun- ing framework for a robotic knee prosthesis, which could enable user preferred robot behavior in the device tuning process. The framework consists of 1) a User-Controlled Interface that allows the user to select their preferred knee kinematics in gait and 2) a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for tuning high-dimension prosthesis control parameters to meet the desired knee kinematics. We evalu- ated the performance of the framework along with usabil- ity of the developed user interface. In addition, we used the developed framework to investigate whether amputee users can exhibit a preference between different profiles during walking and whether they can differentiate between their preferred profile and other profiles when blinded. The results showed effectiveness of our developed framework in tuning 12 robotic knee prosthesis control parameters while meeting the user-selected knee kinematics. A blinded comparative study showed that users can accurately and consistently identify their preferred prosthetic control knee profile. Further, we preliminarily examined gait biomechan- ics of the prosthesis users when walking with different prosthesis control and did not find clear difference between walking with preferred prosthesis control and when walking with normative gait control parameters.

INTRODUCTION Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition with no available cure to date. Despite ongoing research in areas such as stem cell therapy and neuronal regeneration, these fields are still in preclinical states and thus far have made little clinical impact at the patient level. On the other hand, functional electrical stimulation (FES) is already in use in areas such as breathing, bowel and bladder function, and hand grasp [1, 2]. In the past few decades, many researchers have developed FES-based gait restoration systems for persons with paraplegia [3-6], including the commercially-available Parastep system [7]. However, these devices have shown limited everyday usability due to some key limitations such as muscle fatigue, uneven muscle response, and lack of sensing for control purposes, resulting in limited run time and inconsistent gait motions [1, 8]. Some researchers have addressed these problems using hybrid systems combining FES with computer-controlled passive lower limb braces [9-14]. Others have developed fully-powered, electric motor-actuated lower limb exoskeletons without the use of FES [15-22]. The authors have recently developed a powered lower limb exoskeleton, shown in Fig. 1 [23, 24]. Whereas prior publications by the authors have described the design and demonstrated the efficacy of the powered exoskeleton [23, 24], this paper describes the use of supplemental FES of the hamstring muscles to enhance stance phase propulsion during level walking.

Despite recent advances, few products are commercially available and exoskeleton research is still often limited by hardware constraints. Many promising multi-joint assistance strategies, especially those with high- torque and high-power components, have yet to be tested because they are beyond the capabilities of current devices. To study these untested assistance strategies, we present a hip–knee–ankle exoskeleton emulator that can apply high torques and powers that match or exceed those observed in uphill running. The system has powerful off-board motors that actuate a 13.5 kg exoskeleton end effector worn by the user. It can apply up to 200 Nm of torque in hip flexion, hip extension, and ankle plantarflexion, 250 Nm of torque in knee extension, and 140 Nm of torque in knee flexion, with over 4.5 kW of power at each joint and a closed-loop torque bandwidth of at least 18 Hz in each direction of actuation. The exoskeleton is compliant in unactuated directions, adjustable for a wide range of users and comfortable during walking and running. When paired with human-in-the-loop optimization, we expect that this system will identify new assistance strategies to improve human mobility.

To address this challenge, we derived a novel analytical ankle joint moment estimation model using custom wearable sensors and developed an exoskeleton control scheme to adapt assistance proportional to the biological plantar-ﬂexor moment in real-time for unimpaired individuals and individuals with disabilities who are able to ambulate independently. We validated the controller ◦ incline and decline walking, each at multiple during level, 5 ◦ turning (88 ± 3% speeds; stair ascent; stair descent; and 90 average accuracy, R = 0.96 ± 0.01 average correlation coefﬁcient).

Speciﬁcally, the control strategy uses an extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) that fuses angle and velocity measurements from the hip, knee, and ankle joints to estimate the phase and its rate of change. The control strategy then uses these estimates as inputs into Gaussian Process (GP) functions that specify the desired angles, velocities, and feed-forward torques for the knee and ankle joints. These control surfaces are designed to appropriately adapt to speed variations and transitions to standing. We compare this proposed GP-EKF control strategy to both a neuromuscular control (NM) strategy and an impedance control (IMP) strategy in experiments with able-bodied subjects and an amputee subject. We ﬁnd that GP-EKF control generates sig- niﬁcantly more natural knee behavior but slightly less natural ankle behavior than both NM or IMP control. In addition, we ﬁnd in experiments with the subjects stepping on blocks during stance that the GP-EKF control resulted in signiﬁcantly fewer falls than IMP control. Finally, we evaluate the ability of the proposed control to track phase across varying treadmill speeds including sudden stops, and ﬁnd that the EKF’s phase estimate tracks these gait changes signiﬁcantly better than a time-based phase estimate. The proposed control strategy may provide a robust and adaptive control alternative for powered transfemoral prostheses.  relies on the detection of gait events, such as joint angles crossing thresholds, to trigger phase transitions that may cause abrupt changes in torque output as well as unreliable responses to gait disturbances.","id":"7d6b6999-dd15-43fb-a370-e93e99aa4294"}

T., Bartlett, H.L., and Goldfarb M., Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes the design of a new type of knee prosthesis called a stance-control, swing-assist (SCSA) knee prosthesis. The device is motivated by the recognition that energetically-passive stance-controlled microprocessor-controlled knees (SCMPKs) offer many desirable characteristics, such as quiet operation, low weight, high-impedance stance support, and an inertially-driven swing-phase motion. Due to the latter, however, SCMPKs are also highly susceptible to swing-phase perturbations, which can increase the likelihood of falling. The SCSA prosthesis supplements the behavior of an SCMPK with a small motor that maintains the low output impedance of the SCMPK swing state, while adding a supplemental closed-loop controller around it. This paper elaborates upon the motivation for the SCSA prosthesis, describes the design of a prosthesis prototype, and provides human-subject testing data that demonstrates potential device benefits relative to an SCMPK during both non-perturbed and perturbed walking.  Index Terms—Transfemoral, controlled knee, MPK, biomechanics, amputation  prosthesis, microprocessor-  Swing phase is achieved in SCMPKs via inertial coupling between the double-pendulum of the thigh and shank (i.e., forward acceleration of the thigh drives initial knee flexion, while deceleration of the thigh drives subsequently knee extension). A small amount of damping at the knee (relative to the level of stance damping employed in stance-controlled knees) limits excessive knee flexion during swing and avoids terminal impact at full knee extension. One of the substantial benefits of the inertial coupling-based swing-phase movement of passive knee prostheses is that the movement of the knee is naturally and fundamentally coordinated with the movement and intent of the wearer. The same property that enables this natural coordination, however, also makes the swing-phase movement highly-susceptible to perturbations. Specifically, the same low impedance characteristic that enables the wearer to easily enables environmental disturbances, such as stumble or scuff, to substantially influence the movement of the knee. Stance-knee stability relies on full extension at terminal swing, and thus, lack of robustness in swing phase jeopardizes stance-knee stability.  generate  swing-phase motion,  also  I.

To assess the biomechanical evidence in support of advocating the squat lifting technique as an administrative control  to prevent low back pain.  Background. Instruction with respect to lifting technique is commonly employed to prevent low back pain. The squat technique is the most widely advised lifting technique. Intervention studies failed to show health eects of this approach and consequently the rationale behind the advised lifting techniques has been questioned.  Methods. Biomechanical studies comparing the stoop and squat technique were systematically reviewed. The dependent variables used in these studies and the methods by which these were measured or estimated were ranked for validity as indicators of low back load.  Results. Spinal compression as indicated by intra-discal pressure and spinal shrinkage appeared not signiﬁcantly dierent be- tween both lifting techniques. Net moments and compression forces based on model estimates were found to be equal or somewhat higher in squat than in stoop lifting. Only when the load could be lifted from a position in between the feet did squat lifting cause lower net moments, although the studies reporting this ﬁnding had a marginal validity. Shear force and bending moments acting on the spine appeared lower in squat lifting. Net moments and compression forces during lifting reach magnitudes, that can probably cause injury, whereas shear forces and bending moments remained below injury threshold in both techniques.  Conclusion. The biomechanical literature does not provide support for advocating the squat technique as a means of preventing  low back pain.  Relevance  Training in lifting technique is widely used in primary and secondary prevention of low back pain, though health eects have not been proven. The present review assesses the biomechanical evidence supporting the most widely advocated lifting tech- nique.  1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As such, we replaced the prescribed target knee motion by an automat- ically generated proﬁle based on the intact knee. As the proﬁle of the intact knee varies over time due to human adaptation, we are presented with a challenging tracking control problem in the context of classical control theory. By formulating the “echo control” of the robotic knee as a reinforcement learning problem, we provide a promising new tool for real-time tracking control design without explicitly representing the underlying dynamics using a mathematical model, which can be difﬁcult to obtain for a human-robot system.

Nuckols, Krithika Swaminathan, Sangjun Lee, Dheepak Arumukhom Revi, Conor J. Walsh, and Robert D. Howe  Paulson School of Engineering and the Wyss Institute at Harvard, MA, USA.  Abstract—Wearable robotic devices (exosuits, exoskeletons) for augmenting gait can reduce group level metabolic demand. However, at the individual level, metabolic response is variable and the mechanisms behind this inconsistency is unclear. In this work, our aim is to investigate the effect of muscle tendon dynamics on individual response to exosuit assistance. To this end, we measured muscle contraction state of the soleus and medial gastrocnemius using B-mode ultrasound while naïve subjects walked with exosuit assistance. We also sub-categorized subjects into good and poor responders. We found that subjects that responded well (15% reduction) to the assistance began soleus muscle contraction prior to the onset of assistance. Conversely, the soleus muscle contraction began after the onset of assistance in subjects that responded poorly (2% reduction). We also found that the medial gastrocnemius was lengthening at the time of assistance onset in subjects that responded poorly which may highlight the impact of knee mechanics. These findings suggest the importance of energy exchange between the muscle, tendon, joint and environment towards efficient walking and how exosuit assistance might affect those dynamics. Ongoing and future work will expand upon this work and will incorporate EMG, kinematic, and kinetic analysis.  Our aim in this work is to evaluate whether muscle contraction dynamics of the triceps surae can help explain individual response to ankle exosuit assistance. The efficiency of walking is heavily reliant upon proper function of the ankle joint and the muscle-tendon unit (MTU). Efficient and powerful ankle plantarflexion is generated only through properly timed energy exchange between the muscle, the series elastic tendon, the joint, body, and environment. Therefore, understanding and maintaining effective MTU dynamics is also crucial for efficient walking. We suggest that ultrasound-based measurement of muscle dynamics can provide for understanding exosuit performance compared to kinematic, kinetic, and EMG-based measurements. We hypothesize that initial response to exosuit assistance will be predicted by similarity between baseline muscle contraction timing and the onset timing of exosuit assistance.  improved metrics  II.

Our previous study presented a lightweight prosthesis with damping behav- iors, which can adapt to different terrains. However, the proposed prosthesis cannot provide push-off during the stance phase. In this paper, we redesigned the mechanical structure, combining push-off and damping behaviors. The Peking University Robotic Trantibial Prosthesis (PKU- RoboTPro-) II makes a trade-off between push-off power and lightweight. Three unilateral transtibial subjects partic- ipated in the study. Gait symmetry and metabolic cost of walking with the proposed prosthesis were evaluated under conditions of three terrains and four walking speeds. The gait symmetry of the subjects using the prosthesis com- bining push-off and damping behaviors in stance time and ground reaction force distribution are improved. Meanwhile, the PKU-RoboTPro-II with a push-off mode can reduce en- ergy expenditure, with an average 14% ± 8% reduction and a maximal 31% reduction under different conditions, com- pared with a non-push-off mode.

First published October 11, 2012; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.00802.2012.—The springlike mechanics of the human leg during bouncing gaits has inspired the design of passive assistive devices that use springs to aid locomotion. The purpose of this study was to test whether a passive spring-loaded ankle exoskeleton could reduce the mechanical and energetic demands of bilateral hopping on the musculoskeletal sys- tem. Joint level kinematics and kinetics were collected with electro- myographic and metabolic energy consumption data for seven partic- ipants hopping at four frequencies (2.2, 2.5, 2.8, and 3.2 Hz). Hopping was performed without an exoskeleton; with an springless exoskele- ton; and with a spring-loaded exoskeleton. Spring-loaded ankle exo- skeletons reduced plantar ﬂexor muscle activity and the biological contribution to ankle joint moment (15–25%) and average positive power (20–40%). They also facilitated reductions in metabolic power (15–20%) across frequencies from 2.2 to 2.8 Hz compared with hopping with a springless exoskeleton. Reductions in metabolic power compared with hopping with no exoskeleton were restricted to hop- ping at 2.5 Hz only (12%). These results highlighted the importance of reducing the rate of muscular force production and work to achieve metabolic reductions. They also highlighted the importance of assist- ing muscles acting at the knee joint. Exoskeleton designs may need to be tuned to optimize exoskeleton mass, spring stiffness, and spring slack length to achieve greater metabolic reductions.","id":"dc88c203-1c92-4f80-8618-3d5f7a21c993"}

INTRODUCTION  A ROBOTIC exoskeleton is a wearable device worn by  humans and can be attached to human limbs to complete the work together with the movement. It is mainly composed of a frame worn outside the human body and a power system.

How to run 50% faster without external energy Amanda Sutrisno and David J. Braun*  Technological innovations may enable next-generation running shoes to provide unprecedented mobility. But how could a running shoe increase the speed of motion without providing external energy? We found that the top speed of running may be increased more than 50% using a catapult-like exoskeleton device, which does not provide external energy. Our finding uncovers the hidden potential of human performance augmentation via unpowered robotic exoskeletons. Our result may lead to a new-generation of augmentation devices developed for sports, rescue operations, and law enforcement, where humans could benefit from increased speed of motion.  INTRODUCTION The top speed of human running, 12.3 m\/s (1), is near half the top speed of cycling, 21.4 m\/s (2), despite both motions being human powered. The lower speed of running suggests that humans have untapped energy-supplying capability, which can be used in cycling but cannot be used for faster running. Cycling is faster than running partly because (i) the rolling motion of the wheels prevents collisional energy losses from stepping (3) but also because (ii) wheels can support the weight of the body in place of the legs (4, 5), while (iii) pedals enable the human to supply energy continuously in the air (5) instead of intermittently when the leg is on the ground (6). These three features enable the bicycle to double the top speed of running, despite supplying no external energy and adding weight to the human. The same features may lead to novel augmentation devices that could increase the running speed using untapped human power, without wheels or external energy.","id":"dcd5ff5f-1449-470e-8643-9bdfd08b5c51"}

Tree-based BLS (TBLS) is designed for small data modeling by introducing nondifferentiable modules and an ensemble strategy to the traditional broad learning system (BLS). TBLS replaces the neurons of BLS with the tree modules to map the input data. Moreover, we present three new TBLS variant methods and their incremental learning implementations, which are motivated by deep, broad, and ensemble learning. Their major distinction is reﬂected in the incremental learning strategies based on: 1) mean square error (mse); 2) pseudo- inverse; and 3) pseudo-inverse theory and stack representation. Therefore, this study further explores the domain of BLS based on the nondifferentiable modules. The simulations are compared with some state-of-the-art (SOTA) BLS-NN and tree methods under high-, medium-, and low-dimensional benchmark datasets.

The motions are generated by a series of gait states with transitions at specific intervals. The joint trajectories are planned in joint space by interpolating the joint angles of assigned gait states with the dimensions of stairs and wearer. In order to generate the adaptive motion for various dimensions of stairs, multiple sensors and motion adaption strategy with sensing information and fuzzy logic inference are developed to ensure enough foot contact area and to avoid foot-stair collisions. Simulations and experiments of the generated joint trajectories and motion adaptation strategy are conducted on a lower limb exoskeleton. Results show that the proposed joint trajectories provide smooth assistance and the generated motion successfully adapts to various size of stairs. Keywords—exoskeleton; paraplegics; adaptive motion planning; stair ascent and descent. I. INTRODUCTION In the last two decades, exoskeletons have been developed for various applications [1] including human strength augmentation, motion rehabilitation and locomotion assistance for paraplegics. Until now, significant progress has been made in lower limb exoskeletons (LLEs) aiming at assisting locomotion for paraplegics, including ReWalk, Ekso, HAL [2], Vanderbilt exoskeleton [3], Mina [4], and WPAL [5]. Despite the promising progress and results of LLEs for level ground walking, few researchers discussed the strategies of motion assistance for ascending and descending stairs. Development of effective assistance strategies for ascending and descending stairs is an important step towards practical application of exoskeletons in daily life. Since paraplegic patients have lost most of the motor functions in their lower limbs, the control strategy of LLEs for these target users is mainly trajectory tracking [8] without considering effort and participation from the patients. Hence, generating joint trajectories of LLEs for the desired motions is an essential task. The common method of generating joint trajectories for walking assistance with LLE is to collect joint trajectories of healthy individuals.

Thirty elderly adults (15 males\/ 15 females) participated in thispaper. The experimental pro- tocol consisted of overground gait at comfortable speed under three different conditions: free gait without robot assistance, robot-assisted gait with zero torque (RAG-Z), and full RAG. Under all conditions, muscle effort was analyzed using a 12-channel surface electromyography system. Spatio-temporal data were collected at 120 Hz using a 3-D motion capture system with six infrared cam- eras. Metabolic cost parameters were collected as oxygen consumptionperunit(ml\/min\/kg)andaerobicenergyexpen- diture (Kcal\/min).

Some common metrics exist for evaluating these systems, such as metabolic cost, but they are incomplete with regards to the many other characteristics to be compared between systems. To this end, we are developing holistic test methods, speciﬁcally those for lower body wearable robots focused on performance augmentation. We discuss the test methods’ structure, considerations, and development. Prototypes of the test methods have been exercised with a user wearing a B-Temia Dermoskeleton system. Our initial development has led to a baseline set of basic and applied tasks that can be evaluated comparatively between performing the task without and with the system, measuring simple task-based metrics based on time, repetitions, loading capacity, and range of motion. Future work includes exercising the test methods with more wearable robotic systems and formulating a working task group to assist in driving development.  I.  INTRODUCTION  Wearable robots and exoskeletons are a growing technol- ogy that has seen rapid growth in recent years. The most common use of the modern day wearable robot is in medical rehabilitation, with exoskeletons such as the ReWalk 6.0 [1] and the Ekso GT [2], helping users regain limb control and movement while recovering from an injury. Exoskeleton sys- tems are also used in the commercial space with exoskeletons such as the Ekso Works [2], demonstrating use in construction and industrial environments by providing passive augmentation to an able bodied user. For military use, exoskeletons from the Warrior Web Program [3] and the B-Temia Dermoskeleton [4] (see Figure 1), are providing active human augmentation to able bodied users, to extend and improve task performance.

Providing personalized external assistance though is challenging due to uncertainties and the time-varying nature of human-robot interaction. Recently, human-in-the-loop (HIL) op- timization has been investigated for providing assistance to mini- mize energetic expenditure, usually quantiﬁed by metabolic cost. However, this full-body global effect evaluation may not directly reﬂect the local functions of the targeted joint(s). This makes it difﬁcult to assess the direct effect when robotic assistance is pro- vided. In addition, the HIL optimization method usually does not take into account local joint trajectories, a consideration that is important in imposing healthy joint movements and gait patterns for individuals with lower limb motor deﬁcits. In this paper, we propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL)-based control frameworktoachieveanormativerangeofmotionandgaitpattern ofthehipjointduringwalking.OurRL-basedcontrolprovidesper- sonalized assistance torque proﬁle by heuristically manipulating threecontrolparametersforhipﬂexionandextension,respectively, during walking.

How to run 50% faster without external energy Amanda Sutrisno and David J. Braun*  Technological innovations may enable next-generation running shoes to provide unprecedented mobility. But how could a running shoe increase the speed of motion without providing external energy? We found that the top speed of running may be increased more than 50% using a catapult-like exoskeleton device, which does not provide external energy. Our finding uncovers the hidden potential of human performance augmentation via unpowered robotic exoskeletons. Our result may lead to a new-generation of augmentation devices developed for sports, rescue operations, and law enforcement, where humans could benefit from increased speed of motion.  INTRODUCTION The top speed of human running, 12.3 m\/s (1), is near half the top speed of cycling, 21.4 m\/s (2), despite both motions being human powered. The lower speed of running suggests that humans have untapped energy-supplying capability, which can be used in cycling but cannot be used for faster running. Cycling is faster than running partly because (i) the rolling motion of the wheels prevents collisional energy losses from stepping (3) but also because (ii) wheels can support the weight of the body in place of the legs (4, 5), while (iii) pedals enable the human to supply energy continuously in the air (5) instead of intermittently when the leg is on the ground (6). These three features enable the bicycle to double the top speed of running, despite supplying no external energy and adding weight to the human. The same features may lead to novel augmentation devices that could increase the running speed using untapped human power, without wheels or external energy.","id":"dcd5ff5f-1449-470e-8643-9bdfd08b5c51"}

The inertial measure- ment is employed to: 1) provide synergistic movement between the prosthetic elbow joint and intact upper arm and 2) to switch control between the myoelectric elbow and hand. In order to assess the prospective efﬁcacy of the controlmethod, experimentswere conductedon six healthy subjects who performed a series of pick-and-place tasks within a virtual environment. The assessments compared the time required to complete the pick-and-place tasks using the proposed coordinated control approach, with the time required using a sequential control approach (i.e., the conventional approach used in commercial devices). Subjects on average completed the pick-and-place tasks 34%fasterwith thecoordinatedcontrolapproach,relativeto theconventionalsequentialEMG method,withnodifference in compensatory torso motion.  in which a pair of EMG electrodes is placed over the biceps and triceps brachii muscle groups, respectively. The ﬁltered and rectiﬁed signals measured by the agonist\/antagonist pair of EMG electrodes collectively provide a single (bidirectional) control input to the prosthesis. As such, the user has only a single control input with which to control the two components (i.e., the hand and elbow) of the prosthesis. This limitation is typically addressed by multiplexing the single (bidirec- tional) myoelectric control signal between the myoelectric elbow joint and hand, where the multiplexing function is typically performed via a brief muscular co-contraction of the biceps and triceps muscles. Although simple and robust, this “sequential” control approach is considerably less efﬁcient than the simultaneous joint movement characteristic of arm motions in healthy individuals. Further, the sequential method becomes increasingly inefﬁcient with additional myoelectric degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) in the arm (e.g., powered wrist DOFs or multigrasp hands).  transhumeral prosthesis, myoelectric elbow control, electromyograms (EMG) control, coordinated control.

Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Positive biomechanical outcomes have been re- ported with lower-limb exoskeletons in laboratory settings, but these devices have difﬁculty delivering appropriate assistance in synchronywith human gait as the task or rate of phase progression change in real-world environments. This paper presents a torque controller for an ankle exoskeleton that uses state estimation with a data-driven kinematic model to continuously estimate the phase, phase rate, stride length, and ramp parameters during locomotion. The controller applies torque assistance based on the estimated phase and adapts the torque proﬁle based on the estimated task variables to match human torques observed in a multi-activity database of 10 able-bodied subjects. We demonstrate in silico that the controller yields phase estimates that are more accurate than state of the art, while also estimating task variables with compa- rable accuracy to recent machine learning approaches. The con- troller implemented in an ankle exoskeleton successfully adapts its assistance in response to changing phase and task variables, both during controlled treadmill trials (6 able-bodied subjects) and a real-world stress test with extremely uneven terrain.

Panizzolo1,2, Ignacio Galiana1,2, Alan T. Asbeck1,2, Christopher Siviy1,2, Kai Schmidt1,2, Kenneth G. Holt3 and Conor J. Walsh1,2*  Abstract  Background: Carrying load alters normal walking, imposes additional stress to the musculoskeletal system, and results in an increase in energy consumption and a consequent earlier onset of fatigue. This phenomenon is largely due to increased work requirements in lower extremity joints, in turn requiring higher muscle activation. The aim of this work was to assess the biomechanical and physiological effects of a multi-joint soft exosuit that applies assistive torques to the biological hip and ankle joints during loaded walking. Methods: The exosuit was evaluated under three conditions: powered (EXO_ON), unpowered (EXO_OFF) and unpowered removing the equivalent mass of the device (EXO_OFF_EMR). Seven participants walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill and carried a load equivalent to 30 % their body mass. We assessed their metabolic cost of walking, kinetics, kinematics, and lower limb muscle activation using a portable gas analysis system, motion capture system, and surface electromyography.  Results: Our results showed that the exosuit could deliver controlled forces to a wearer. Net metabolic power in the EXO_ON condition (7.5 ± 0.6 W kg−1) was 7.3 ± 5.0 % and 14.2 ± 6.1 % lower than in the EXO_OFF_EMR condition (7.9 ± 0.8 W kg−1; p = 0.027) and in the EXO_OFF condition (8.5 ± 0.9 W kg−1; p = 0.005), respectively. The exosuit also reduced the total joint positive biological work (sum of hip, knee and ankle) when comparing the EXO_ON condition (1.06 ± 0.16 J kg−1) with respect to the EXO_OFF condition (1.28 ± 0.26 J kg−1; p = 0.020) and to the EXO_OFF_EMR condition (1.22 ± 0.21 J kg−1; p = 0.007). Conclusions: The results of the present work demonstrate for the first time that a soft wearable robot can improve walking economy. These findings pave the way for future assistive devices that may enhance or restore gait in other applications.

Fylstra1,2†, I‑Chieh Lee1,2†, Minhan Li1,2, Michael D. Lewek3 and He Huang1,2*  Abstract Background: Personalizing prosthesis control is often structured as human‑in‑the‑loop optimization. However, gait performance is influenced by both human control and intelligent prosthesis control. Hence, we need to consider both human and prosthesis control, and their cooperation, to achieve desired gait patterns. In this study, we devel‑ oped a novel paradigm that engages human gait control via user‑fed visual feedback (FB) of stance time to cooperate with automatic prosthesis control tuning. Three initial questions were studied: (1) does user control of gait timing (via visual FB) help the prosthesis tuning algorithm to converge faster? (2) in turn, does the prosthesis control influence the user’s ability to reach and maintain the target stance time defined by the feedback? and (3) does the prosthesis control parameters tuned with extended stance time on prosthesis side allow the user to maintain this potentially beneficial behavior even after feedback is removed (short‑ and long‑term retention)?  Methods: A reinforcement learning algorithm was used to achieve prosthesis control to meet normative knee kinematics in walking. A visual FB system cued the user to control prosthesis‑side stance time to facilitate the pros‑ thesis tuning goal. Seven individuals without amputation (AB) and four individuals with transfemoral amputation (TFA) walked with a powered knee prosthesis on a treadmill. Participants completed prosthesis auto‑tuning with three visual feedback conditions: no FB, self‑selected stance time FB (SS FB), and increased stance time FB (Inc FB). The retention of FB effects was studied by comparing the gait performance across three different prosthesis controls, tuned with different visual FB.","id":"6d3f5c45-8a0d-4501-8eea-c71a4d4544f9"}

Here we show that exoskeleton optimization can be performed rapidly and under real-world conditions. We designed a portable ankle exoskeleton based on insights from tests with a versatile laboratory testbed. We developed a data-driven method for optimizing exoskeleton assistance outdoors using wearable sensors and found that it was equally effective as laboratory methods, but identified optimal parameters four times faster. We performed real-world optimization using data collected during many short bouts of walking at varying speeds. Assistance optimized during one hour of naturalistic walking in a public setting increased self-selected speed by 9 ± 4% and reduced the energy used to travel a given distance by 17 ± 5% compared with normal shoes. This assistance reduced metabolic energy consumption by 23 ± 8% when participants walked on a treadmill at a standard speed of 1.5 m s−1. Human movements encode information that can be used to personalize assistive devices and enhance performance.  Exoskeletons that assist leg movement show promise for enhancing personal mobility but have yet to provide real-world benefits. Millions of people have mobility impairments that make walking slower5 and more fatiguing6, while millions more people have occupations that require strenuous locomotion7. In research laboratories, exoskele- tons can increase walking speed1,8,9 and reduce the energy required to walk2–4,10–16, but these benefits have not yet translated to real-world conditions17. Providing beneficial assistance in the real world is difficult for several reasons: the specialized equipment used to personalize assistance is not available outside the laboratory; unlike walking on a treadmill, everyday walking occurs in many bouts of varying speed and duration; and devices must be self-contained and easy to use. In this study, we addressed each of these challenges to demonstrate effective exoskeleton assistance under naturalistic conditions.","id":"9716b96f-b630-4671-8d08-543a97fc4e83"}

Functional outcomes can be improved through manual treadmill therapy, but high costs limit patient exposure and, thereby, outcomes. Robotic gait training could increase the viable duration and frequency of training sessions, but robotic approaches employed thus far have been less effective than manual therapy. These shortcomings may relate to subconscious energy-minimizing drives, which might cause patients to engage less actively in therapy when provided with corrective robotic assistance. We have devised a new method for gait rehabilitation that harnesses, rather than ﬁghts, least-effort tendencies. Therapeutic goals, such as increased use of the paretic limb, are made easier than the patient’s nominal gait through selective assistance from a robotic platform. We performed a pilot test on a healthy subject (N = 1) in which altered self-selected stride length was induced using a tethered robotic ankle-foot orthosis. The subject ﬁrst walked on a treadmill while wearing the orthosis with and without assistance at unaltered and voluntarily altered stride length. Voluntarily increasing stride length by 5% increased metabolic energy cost by 4%. Robotic assistance decreased energy cost at both unaltered and voluntarily increased stride lengths, by 6% and 8% respectively. We then performed a test in which the robotic system continually monitored stride the subject’s stride length and provided more assistance if length approached a target increase. This adaptive assistance protocol caused the subject to slowly adjust their gait patterns towards the target, leading to a 4% increase in stride length. Metabolic energy consumption was simultaneously reduced by 5%. These results suggest that selective-assistance protocols based on targets relevant to rehabilitation might lead patients to self- select desirable gait patterns during robotic gait training sessions, possibly facilitating better adherence and outcomes.

The OA causes results in joint damage. Knee osteoarthritis is one of the major disease which causes damages in the cartilage between femur and tibia. The patellofemoral region is mainly involved in knee osteoarthritis. The main aim of this study is to measure the forces during the walking movement in left and right part of patello femoral joint for OA patients and normal subjects. The objective is to design a circuit to measure forces and to test the difference between OA patients and normal subjects. The hardware circuit was designed using NI ELVIS ( National Instrument Educational Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Suite), which is used to interface the sensors with the labVIEW software. The labVIEW software is used to acquire data from the sensors. The circuit was designed using two FSR sensors (Force Sensitive Resistor) which are fitted to the upper part of the patellofemoral joint on right and left knee separately. The forces which are obtained by the walking movement within the duration of three minutes. The measured output shows a decrement in force compare to normal and OA subjects and it also has been identified that right knee force is greater than left knee force .

We propose a new method combining the strengths of traditional laboratory studies where environment is strictly controlled, and ﬁeld-based studies where subjects behave naturally. We use a foot-mounted inertial sensor, a GPS receiver and a barometric altitude sensor to reconstruct a subject’s path and detailed foot movement, both indoors and outdoors, during days-long measurement using strapdown navigation and sensor fusion algorithms. We cluster repeated movement paths based on location, and propose that on these paths, most environmental and behavioral factors (e.g., terrain and motivation) are as repeatable as in a laboratory. During each bout of movement along a frequently repeated path, any synchronized measurement can be isolated for study, enabling focused statistical comparison of diﬀerent interventions. We conducted a 10-day test on one subject wearing athletic shoes and sandals each for ﬁve days. The algorithm detected four frequently-repeated straight walking paths with at least 300 total steps and repetitions on at least three days for each condition. Results on these frequently-repeated paths indicated signiﬁcantly lower foot clearance and shorter stride length and a trend toward decreased stride width when wearing athletic shoes vs. sandals. Comparisons based on all straight walking were similar, showing greater statistical power, but higher variability in the data. The proposed method oﬀers a new way to evaluate how mobility interventions aﬀect everyday movement behavior.

There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in knee motion between the patients and normal subjects. The patients with knee OA had a signiﬁcantly reduced internal knee extensor moment compared to normal subjects. This diﬀerence reﬂects the patient’s compensation to reduce the knee joint loading. Further, subjects with OA and a higher body mass index have a lower knee extensor moment. The female subjects had signiﬁcantly greater knee ﬂexion and a greater knee extensor moment. This gender diﬀerence may partially explain the increased prevalence of OA in females. Most tests of OA treatments are assessed by criteria that do not reﬂect functional activities. This study demonstrates that objective gait analysis can be used to document gait adaptations used by patients with knee OA. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This disease is particularly disabling when the knees are aﬀected. It is estimated that 9% of men and 18% of women over age 65 have knee OA (Davis et al., 1991). Individuals with knee OA experience pain, stiﬀness, and decreased range of motion of the joints. These symptoms signiﬁcantly limit an individual’s ability to rise from a chair, stand comfor- tably, walk, or climb stairs. Ultimately, these limitations lead to a loss of functional independence.  The mechanics of walking on a level surface are well understood and characterized (Bresler and Frankel, 1950; Perry, 1992). Several studies have also analyzed the mechanics of stair walking. Kinematic and kinetic data of the lower limb in the sagittal plane during stair ascent and descent have been described in the sagittal plane (Andriacchi et al., 1980; McFadyen and Winter, 1988), and the frontal plane (Andriacchi et al., 1980;","id":"1cb7f505-9273-4ab9-91a8-2c41fbef3455"}

But, lacking a mechanistic understanding of to assistive technologies, the state of the art in design development is presently a sophisticated form of automated trial and error. the restrictions of human Progress experimentation that make it difficult to assess the direct impact of wearable robots on underlying muscles, tendons and bones. The next stage of development in wearable robotics requires expanding studies ‘under the skin’ and ‘out into the world’. Developing animal models to explore locomotion with wearable robotics could offer the opportunity to answer questions up and down the broader spatiotemporal scale that are not currently possible in humans. To fill this gap, we have built the first ever wearable robotic device for a freely-locomoting, non-human, bipedal animal (Numida melaegris = Guinea fowl), a species whose gait closely mirror human locomotion mechanics. We found that a passive soft-exosuit design that parallels current human passive-elastic ankle exoskeletons in function was both well tolerated and provided consistent torques. Preliminary data showed birds systematically change their kinematics in response to changes to exo-suit spring stiffness, adjusting the timing but not magnitude of the assistive torques. This animal model for wearable robotics allows us to address questions from short- term adaptations in musculoskeletal dynamics and sensorimotor signaling within a single step to broader behavioral and physical changes that come with long term use from whole-body down to individual muscles and nerves.  the biological response  is hampered by  Figure 1: An animal model for wearable robotics overcomes the limitations of human experimentation, expanding spatial and temporal scales of research.  wearable robotics lacks an animal model with which to conduct invasive or long-term experiments.

Nuckols1, Louis N. Awad2 and Conor J.

However, understanding of the effects of resisting plantarflexion during stance on joint kinetics and muscle activity—key outcomes in evaluating its potential value in rehabilitation—remains limited. This initial study uses a unilateral exosuit that resists plantarflexion during mid-late stance in unimpaired individuals to test the hypotheses that when plantarflexion is resisted, individuals would (1) increase plantarflexor ankle torque and muscle activity locally at the resisted ipsilateral ankle, but (2) at higher forces, exhibit a generalized response that also uses the unresisted joints and limb. Further, we expected (3) short-term retention into gait immediately after removal of resistance. Methods: Ten healthy young adults walked at 1.25 m s− exposure to active exosuit-applied resistance, and post-active sections. In each bout, a different force magnitude was applied based on individual baseline ankle torques. The peak resistance torque applied by the exosuit was 0.13 0.01, 0.19 1 Results: (1) Across all bouts, participants increased peak ipsilateral biological ankle torque by 0.13–0.25 N m kg− (p < 0.001) during exosuit-applied resistance compared to corresponding baselines. Additionally, ipsilateral soleus activity during stance increased by 5.4–11.3% (p < 0.05) in all but the LOW bout. (2) In the HIGH and MAX bouts, vertical ground reaction force decreased on the ipsilateral limb while increasing on the contralateral limb (p < 0.01).

Such devices have been the subject of research for many years and various mechanism design and control issues have been discussed in the literature, see, for example, a comprehensive overview by Dollar and Herr [2]. Whether augmenting abilities or improv- ing disabilities, the purpose of assistive exoskeleton devices is to provide useful mechanical power by means of synchronous operation with the person that is wearing it [3].

In this study, a knee exoskeleton rehabilitation robot driven by a quasi-direct driver actuator is designed. The torque generation model is constructed based on the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network, and the knee joint torque is generated by sEMG and angle signal. A joint attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of torque generation model. The impedance control parameters are adaptively adjusted in accordance with the joint torque. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network is capable of effectively estimating torque, the mean MAE and CC of the proposed model are 1.141Nm and 93.7%, respectively. The optimized impedance control can optimize the initial value of the impedance parameter, which reduced the torque error by 5.54% and 50.64% at uphill tasks and walking task, respectively, and adaptively adjust the impedance parameter to ensure the coordination of the gait rehabilitation and the friendly human- robot interaction.

The strategy was designed with an auto- matic training algorithm which could update the classiﬁers with the data of the most recent completed gait cycles to seize the changes of the features brought by external disturbances. After implementation, we measured multiple experimental sessions on six transtibial amputees with intervals from a few hours (inter-session experiment) to several months (108 days at most in inter-day experiment). In each session,they performed ﬁve locomotion modes and eight locomotion transitions using the robotic prosthesis. Between each two experimental sessions, the subjects were required to doff the robotic prosthesis (including the socket). The proposed adaptive recognition algorithm sig- niﬁcantly improved recognition accuracies in both experi- ments.

The different maneuvers are commanded by the user based on postural information measured by the device. The proposed user interface and control structure was implemented on a powered lower limb orthosis, and the system was tested on a paraplegic subject with a T10 com- plete injury.

Article deals with the analysis of design exoskeleton for people with disabilities, in order to analyze significant events that are currently crucial in the creation or modification of various visual styles in design. The exoskeleton is carryable robotic device connected to the human body. Its design and of course its functionality modified and improved in time. Aesthetics of exoskeletons was influenced by on which elements they are based in designing - the predominance of a particular element decides how it is eventually perceived. An important part of creating ideas is to establish criteria that will set the direction and certain limits. The objective is also to find the most important connectins of shape, color and material features that make up a coherent design. Introduction The English word design is derived from the Latin de-signare, meaning to mark or indicate and in time the terms such as a proposal or to design were implemented. The aim of the design is to link the functional and aesthetic aspects of the proposed device in the most rational way, which requires technical and artistic skills and knowledge. The design is extremely varied, vital and ever-changing issue, different categories of which are complementary. It is present in many forms from useful and beautiful objects to waste, air pollution, disposal of mineral resources, transportation and environmental collapse, but it may help the sick, the elderly and handicapped. The presence of design is all around us. Initial impression For simple assessment the criteria of excellence of design we do not need to be experts in the field. Each of us is able to conclude whether a particular aesthetic appearance of the object acts upon us positively or negatively. If the effect is negative, there is sometning wrong in the proposal. The designer would therefore cooperate in the process of creating the draft not only with constructor, but also with doctor, psychologist and other professionals dealing fox example with physiology.

ACCEPTED DECEMBER, 2023  Robustification of Bayesian-Inference-Based Gait Estimation for Lower-limb Wearable Robots Ting-Wei Hsu1, Robert D. Gregg2, and Gray C. Thomas3  Abstract—Lower-limb wearable robots designed to assist peo- ple in everyday activities must reliably recover from any mo- mentary confusion about what the user is doing. Such confusion might arise from momentary sensor failure, collision with an obstacle, losing track of gait due to an out-of-distribution stride, etc. Systems that infer a user’s walking condition from angle measurements using Bayesian filters (e.g., extended Kalman filters) have been shown to accurately track gait across a range of activities. However, due to the fundamental problem structure and assumptions of Bayesian filter implementations, such estimators risk becoming ‘lost’ with little hope of a quick recovery. In this paper, we 1) introduce a Monte Carlo- based metric to quantify the robustness of pattern-tracking gait estimators, 2) propose strategies for improving tracking robustness, and 3) systematically evaluate them against this new metric using a publicly available gait biomechanics dataset. Our results, aggregating 2,700 trials of simulated walking of 10 able- bodied subjects under random perturbations, suggest that drastic improvements in robustness (from 8.9% to 99%) are possible using relatively simple modifications to the estimation process without noticeably degrading estimator accuracy.

In this study, we sought to simultaneously and independently assess patient and prosthetist preference for prosthetic foot stiffness using a custom variable-stiffness prosthesis. In the first part of the experiment, seven subjects with below-knee amputation walked on the variable-stiffness prosthetic foot set to a randomized stiffness, while several prosthetist subjects simultaneously observed their gait. After each trial, the amputee subjects and prosthetist subjects indicated the change to stiffness that they would prefer (increase or decrease). this paradigm allowed us to simultaneously measure amputee subject and prosthetist subject preferences, and provided a reliability index indicating the consistency of their preferences. In the second part of the experiment, amputee subjects were instructed to communicate verbally with one prosthetist subject to arrive at a mutually preferred stiffness. On average, prosthetist subjects preferred a 26% higher stiffness than amputee subjects (p < 0.001), though this depended on the amputee subject (p < 0.001). Prosthetist subjects were also considerably less consistent than amputee subjects in their preferences (CV of 5.6% for amputee subjects, CV of 23% for prosthetist subjects; p = 0.014).

In this paper, a human-robot cooperation control method using compliance factor with feedback torque and adjustable stiffness is proposed, which can arbitrarily change the current motion trajectory according to the user's active intention torque, while the knee exoskeleton can maintain the compliance and stability of the motion. The compliance factor includes stiffness adjustment items and torque adjustment items. The stiffness change feedback based on SEA improves the flexibility. The intention amplification function is designed to enhance the user's active intention. The proposed method is validated by the designed knee exoskeleton. When feedback compliance factor, knee exoskeleton has good compliance and flexibility.

INTRODUCTION Wearable lower limb exoskeleton robots have been developed to assist in treating stroke and other diseases, enhance human strength, or supplement human capabilities [1], [2], [3]. A variety of assisted exoskeleton robots have been developed to help humans complete the desired motions and tasks [4], [5]. The exoskeleton robot has direct physical interaction with human work, so human-robot interaction (human-robot interaction) or human-robot cooperation has become a hot field in robotics [6], [7]. In order to achieve seamless and intuitive human-robot cooperation, an important task is to let robots understand human intentions. Predefined motions cannot meet the control requirements of human-machine collaboration, and researchers have developed control methods based on human intention feedback [8], [9].

Consequently, in the field of wearable robotics, there is a clear need for customizing assistance to the user and task. Here, we developed a muscle-based assistance (MBA) strategy wherein exosuit assistance was derived from direct mea- surements of individuals’ muscle dynamics during specific tasks. We recorded individuals’ soleus muscle dynam- ics using ultrasonographic imaging during multiple walking speeds and inclines. From these prerecorded images, we estimated the force produced by the soleus through inefficient concentric contraction and designed the exo- suit assistance profile to be proportional to that estimated force. We evaluated this approach with a bilateral ankle exosuit at each measured walking task. Compared with not wearing a device, the MBA ankle exosuit significantly −1 , reduced metabolic demand by an average of 15.9, 9.7, and 8.9% for level walking at 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75 meters second at 5.71° incline while applying lower assistance levels than in existing respectively, and 7.8% at 1.25 meters second literature. In an additional study (n = 2), we showed for multiple walking tasks that the MBA profile outperforms other bioinspired strategies and the average profile from a previous optimization study. Last, we show the feasibility of online assistance generation in a mobile version for overground outdoor walking. This muscle-based approach enables relatively rapid (~10 seconds) generation of individualized low-force assistance profiles that provide metabolic benefit. This approach may help support the adoption of wearable robotics in real-world, dynamic locomotor tasks by enabling comfortable, tailored, and adaptive assistance.  −1","id":"1cb8cfd4-960f-425c-ae14-3a66e510aea6"}

Gregg, and Maani Ghaffari  Abstract—Powered prosthetic legs must anticipate the user’s intent when switching between different locomotion modes (e.g., level walking, stair ascent\/descent, ramp ascent\/descent). Numerous data-driven classiﬁcation techniques have demon- strated promising results for predicting user intent, but the performance of these intent prediction models on novel subjects remains undesirable. In other domains (e.g., image classiﬁca- tion), transfer learning has improved classiﬁcation accuracy by using previously learned features from a large dataset (i.e., pre-trained models) and then transferring this learned model to a new task where a smaller dataset is available. In this paper, we develop a deep convolutional neural network with intra-subject (subject-dependent) and inter-subject (subject- independent) validations based on a human locomotion dataset. We then apply transfer learning for the subject-independent model using a small portion (10%) of the data from the left-out subject. We compare the performance of these three models. Our results indicate that the transfer learning (TL) model outperforms the subject-independent (IND) model and is comparable to the subject-dependent (DEP) model (DEP Error: 0.74 ± 0.002%, IND Error: 11.59 ± 0.076%, TL Error: 3.57 ± 0.02% with 10% data). Moreover, as expected, transfer learning accuracy increases with the availability of more data from the left-out subject. We also evaluate the performance of the intent prediction system in various sensor conﬁgurations that may be available in a prosthetic leg application. Our results suggest that a thigh IMU on the the prosthesis is sufﬁcient to predict locomotion intent in practice.  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"013e5894-1aac-4718-9090-a814afde4a7d"}

Abstract—Lower limb prosthesis can beneﬁt from embedded systems capable of applying computer vision techniques to en- hance autonomous control and context awareness for intelligent decision making. In order to ﬁll in the gap of current literature of autonomous systems for prosthetic legs employing computer vision methods, we evaluate the performance capabilities of two off-the-shelf platforms, the Jetson TX2 and Raspberry Pi 3, by assessing their CPU load, memory usage, run time and classiﬁcation accuracy for different image sizes and widespread computer vision algorithms. We make use of a dataset that we collected for terrain recognition using images from a camera mounted on a leg, which would enable context-awareness for lower limb prosthesis. We show that, given reasonably large images and an appropriate frame selection method, it is possible to identify the terrain that a subject is going to step on, with the possibility of reconstructing the surface and obtaining its inclination. This is part of a proposed system equipped with an embedded camera and inertial measurement unit to recognize different types of terrain and estimate the slope of the surface in front of the subject.  I. INTRODUCTION  The relevance of providing a better quality of life to people with limb loss has only increased over time. The prospective amputee population growth is estimated to reach about 3.6 million by 2050 in the United States alone [1]. In order to improve amputee’s quality of life, diverse types of prostheses have been employed; however, there is no prosthetic solution to date that completely addresses the lack of comfort, reliability, and safety to the user, which are claimed by several amputees as the main reasons not to wear them [2]. One of the main challenges is to provide devices that are able to be natural extensions of the human body, which is an open research topic that branches across several areas: orthopedics, cardiology, neurology and many areas of engineering.","id":"cf82acd0-bef8-458d-8a50-fd77644941f3"}

So far, most neuromechanical simulation studies have focused on demonstrating the capability of a proposed control model these models with competing control hypotheses can generate human-like normal walking behaviors, a more in-depth evaluation is required. Here, we conduct the more in-depth evaluation on a spinal-reﬂex-based control model using ﬁve representative gait disturbances, ranging from electrical stimulation to mechanical perturbation at individual leg joints and at the whole body. The immediate changes in muscle activations of the model are compared to those of humans across different gait phases and disturbance magnitudes. Remarkably similar response trends for the majority of investigated muscles and experimental conditions reinforce the plausibility of the reﬂex circuits of the model. However, the model’s responses lack in amplitude for two experiments with whole body disturbances suggesting that in these cases the proposed reﬂex circuits need to be ampliﬁed by additional control structures such as location-speciﬁc cutaneous reﬂexes. A model that captures these selective ampliﬁcations would be able to explain both steady and reactive spinal control of human locomotion.

This study aimed to evaluate the effec- tiveness of our exoskeleton in assisting squatting motion using the COP variability as a metric. Six human subjects performed alternate squatting and standing movements while their foot pressure and COP trajecto- ries were recorded using insole pressure sensors. The exercises were performed under three conditions: i) no device, ii) unpowered device, and iii) device with optimal stiffness. Results showed that the variability of the COP trajectory in the anterior-posterior direction of the foot during squatting tended to be lower for the optimal stiffness condition than the no device and unpowered device conditions, indicating the potential usefulness of the device in improving balance during squatting. This study has implications for human-in- the-loop optimization and balance control of the exoskeleton based on COP.  INTRODUCTION  Squatting exercises are frequently used in resistance train- ing and rehabilitation to help people recover from injuries to their lower extremities (McGinty, Irrgang, & Pezzullo, 2000; Yu, Kumar, Turk, & Liu, 2019). Squatting is a symmetric bi- lateral exercise, which can be used to strengthen muscles on one or both sides of the body, depending on patient needs (Luo et al., 2021). Perhaps, squat exercise can be further motivated with a reliable lower extremity exoskeleton, instead of human aids. Such exoskeletons typically employ model-based control methods as balance controller designs (Shi, Zhang, Zhang, & Ding, 2019; Xiong, 2014). Such methods, however, are not very robust against large and unexpected perturbations caused by human interactions (Luo et al., 2021). In other words, un- predictable human-exoskeleton interaction forces and perturba- tions may cause conventional balance controllers to operate un- reliably.","id":"fa17515f-ccbe-4399-b289-d7a45c7042da"}

In this study, a knee exoskeleton rehabilitation robot driven by a quasi-direct driver actuator is designed. The torque generation model is constructed based on the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network, and the knee joint torque is generated by sEMG and angle signal. A joint attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of torque generation model. The impedance control parameters are adaptively adjusted in accordance with the joint torque. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network is capable of effectively estimating torque, the mean MAE and CC of the proposed model are 1.141Nm and 93.7%, respectively. The optimized impedance control can optimize the initial value of the impedance parameter, which reduced the torque error by 5.54% and 50.64% at uphill tasks and walking task, respectively, and adaptively adjust the impedance parameter to ensure the coordination of the gait rehabilitation and the friendly human- robot interaction.

Despite recent technological and scientiﬁc achievements, more research is needed to realize the promise of intuitive, easy-to-wear, safe, and effective wearable robots. Directions of current technical innovation and future trends include the following.  1) Improved Sensing, Actuation, and Computation: New technologies are enabling better sensing and interpretation of human–robot interaction, new actuators are enabling better in- teraction, and enhanced computing power is enabling complex reasoning and control strategies. In particular, the emerging area of soft wearable robots has started to see exciting results from studies with various populations. There are now commercially available soft wearable rehabilitation robots for the lower and upper extremity of subjects who have suffered a stroke. In addi- tion, soft exosuits for the back help workers perform physically strenuous tasks in industry, alleviating injuries and providing a safer work environment.  2) Better Assessment: Currently, we lack standardized frameworks for evaluating the effectiveness of wearable robots, but this is beginning to change.

Adam Quirk1,3, Jason M. Cherin1, Dennis Friedrich1, Daekyum Kim1,2 & Conor J. Walsh1  Back exoskeletons are gaining attention for preventing occupational back injuries, but they can disrupt movement, a burden that risks abandonment. Enhanced adaptability is proposed to mitigate burdens, but perceptual benefits are less known. This study investigates the perceptual and biomechanical impacts of a SLACK suit (non-assistive) controller versus three controllers with varying adaptability: a Weight-Direction-Angle adaptive (WDA-ADPT) that scales assistance based on the weight of the boxes using a chest-mounted camera and machine learning algorithm, movement direction, and trunk flexion angle, and standard Direction-Angle adaptive (DA-ADPT) and Angle adaptive (A-ADPT) controllers. Fifteen participants performed a variable weight (2, 8, 14 kg) box-transfer task. WDA-ADPT achieved the highest perceptual score (88%) across survey categories and reduced peak back extensor (BE) muscle amplitudes by 10.1%. DA-ADPT had slightly lower perceptual (76%) and peak BE reduction (8.5%). A-ADPT induced hip restriction, which could explain the lowest perceptual score (55%) despite providing the largest reductions in peak BE muscle activity (17.3%). Reduced perceptual scores achieved by DA and A-ADPT were explained by controllers providing too much or little assistance versus actual task demands. These findings underscore that scaling assistance to task demands improves biomechanical benefits and the perception of the device’s suitability.  Back exos, including exoskeletons and exosuits, have been developed to reduce the risk of occupational low back injuries (LBI)1posed by tasks with high peak and cumulative lumbar moments2–4. Engineering controls designed to reduce lumbar moments, such as adjusting table height and installing electric hoists, have demonstrated reductions in LBI rates5. Given that back exos effectively reduce back extensor (BE) moments and muscle activity1, they could mitigate the risk of developing occupational LBIs6,7. However, devices must have a high intention to maximize this potential8.","id":"55c31e5b-8329-422e-9a3c-81b06a3435ce"}

Lerner, Diane L. Damiano, and Thomas C. Bulea, Member, IEEE  Abstract—Individuals with cerebral palsy frequently exhibit crouch gait, a pathological walking pattern characterized by excessive knee ﬂexion. Knowledge of the knee joint moment during crouch gait is necessary for the design and control of assistive devices used for treatment. Our goal was to 1) develop statistical models to estimate knee joint moment extrema and dynamic stiffness during crouch gait, and 2) use the models to es- timate the instantaneous joint moment during weight-acceptance. We retrospectively computed knee moments from 10 children with crouch gait and used stepwise linear regression to develop statistical models describing the knee moment features. The models explained at least 90% of the response value variability: peak moment in early (99%) and late (90%) stance, and dy- namic stiffness of weight-acceptance ﬂexion (94%) and extension (98%). We estimated knee extensor moment proﬁles from the predicted dynamic stiffness and instantaneous knee angle. This approach captured the timing and shape of the computed moment (root-mean-squared error: 2.64 Nm); including the predicted early-stance peak moment as a correction factor improved model performance (root-mean-squared error: 1.37 Nm). Our strategy provides a practical, accurate method to estimate the knee mo- ment during crouch gait, and could be used for real-time, adaptive control of robotic orthoses.

Gregg, Tommaso Lenzi, Nicholas P. Fey, Levi J. Hargrove, and Jonathon W. Sensinger  Abstract—This paper presents the design and experimental feedback control strategy that implementation of a novel regulates effective shape on a powered transfemoral prosthesis. The human effective shape is the effective geometry to which the biological leg conforms—through movement of ground reaction forces and leg joints—during the stance period of gait. Able- bodied humans regulate effective shapes to be invariant across conditions such as heel height, walking speed, and body weight, so this measure has proven to be a very useful tool for the alignment and design of passive prostheses. However, leg joints must be actively controlled to assume different effective shapes that are unique to tasks such as standing, walking, and stair climbing. Using our previous simulation studies as a starting point, we model and control the effective shape as a virtual kinematic constraint on the powered Vanderbilt prosthetic leg with a custom instrumented foot. An able-bodied subject used a by-pass adapter to walk on the controlled leg over ground and over a treadmill. These preliminary experiments demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, that effective shape (or virtual constraints in general) can be used to control a powered prosthetic leg.  I. INTRODUCTION  The effective shape of the human leg during locomotor tasks (called the rollover shape during walking) has been studied for over a decade [1] and has proven to be a very useful measure for gait analysis and prosthesis alignment [2], [3]. The effective shape is the trajectory of the center of pressure (COP)—the point on the plantar sole of the foot where the cumulative reaction force is imparted against the ground—mapped into a moving reference frame attached to the stance leg. For a rigid object, e.g., a metal wheel, the effective shape is its actual geometry. However, the effective shape of an object that includes a compliant or controllable joint—such as a human or prosthetic ankle—is variable and can be regulated, for example, within the local coordinate frame of the shank or thigh.

As such, the user has only a single control input with which to control the two components (i.e., the hand and elbow) of the prosthesis. This limitation is typically addressed by multiplexing the single (bidirec- tional) myoelectric control signal between the myoelectric elbow joint and hand, where the multiplexing function is typically performed via a brief muscular co-contraction of the biceps and triceps muscles.

It represents a step toward building more efﬁcient and effective machine-learning methods that can be extended to a broader range of necessary research ﬁelds. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the BLS in data mining and neural networks for the ﬁrst time, focus- ing on summarizing various BLS methods from the aspects of its algorithms, theories, applications, and future open research questions. First, we introduce the basic pattern of BLS man- ifestation, the universal approximation capability, and essence from the theoretical perspective. Furthermore, we focus on BLS’s various improvements based on the current state of the theoreti- cal research, which further improves its ﬂexibility, stability, and accuracy under general or speciﬁc conditions, including classiﬁca- tion, regression, semisupervised, and unsupervised tasks. Due to its remarkable efﬁciency, impressive generalization performance, and easy extendibility, BLS has been applied in different domains.

INTRODUCTION  T HERE are between 40 000 and 100 000 individuals in the  U.S. with major upper extremity limb loss, roughly 40% of whom are transhumeral (above elbow) amputees [1], [2]. Transhumeral prostheses can aid individuals with transhumeral amputation to more capably perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Two major types of functional upper extremity pros- theses exist—the body-powered type and the myoelectric type. In the case of a transhumeral prosthesis, both types typically include an elbow joint and a terminal device (often either a split hook or a hand). The body-powered prosthesis type in- corporates Bowden cables, typically a pair, both attached to a shoulder harness worn by the user, such that the appropriate movement of the shoulder (e.g., shoulder ﬂexion and scapular abduction) will generate excursion of the respective cable. Al- though different variations exist, a common embodiment is the dual-control system, in which one cable (e.g., coupled to shoul- der ﬂexion) is used to provide movement of both the elbow and terminal device (i.e., cable excursion will simultaneously actu- ate both elbow ﬂexion and terminal device opening), while the other cable (e.g., coupled to scapular abduction) is used to lock or unlock the elbow [3]. Because opening the terminal device (against elastic bands) typically requires higher cable forces","id":"e54db071-4770-4b21-af71-ad927b4f8f4b"}

It senses and monitors the delivered force and power of the exoskeleton for motion control and taking urgent safety action. Two FSR (force-sensitive resistors) sensors are used to measure the assistance force when the user is walking. The sensor system directly measures the interaction force between the exoskeleton and the lower limb of the user instead of a previously reported force-sensing method, which estimated the hip assistance force from the current of the motor and lookup tables. Furthermore, the sensor system has the advantage of generating torque in the walking-assistant actuator based on directly measuring the hip-assistance force. Thus, the gait-assistance exoskeleton system can control the delivered power and torque to the user. The force sensing structure is designed to decouple the force caused by hip motion from other directional forces to the sensor so as to only measure that force. We conﬁrmed that the hip-assistance force could be measured with the proposed prototype compact force sensor attached to a thigh frame through an experiment with a real system.

Joint muscular torques (JMT) reﬂect human effort, which can be applied on an exoskeleton robot to realize an active power-assist function. The estimation of human JMT with a wearable exoskeleton is challenging. This paper proposed a novel human lower limb JMT estimation method based on the inverse dynamics of the human body. The method has two main parts: the inverse dynamic approach (IDA) and the sensing system. We solve the inverse dynamics of each human leg separately to shorten the serial chain and reduce computational complexity, and divide the JMT into the mass-induced one and the foot-contact-force (FCF)-induced one to avoid switching the dynamic equation due to different contact states of the feet. An exoskeleton embedded sensing system is designed to obtain the user’s motion data and FCF required by the IDA by mapping motion information from the exoskeleton to the human body. Compared with the popular electromyography (EMG) and wearable sensor based solutions, electrodes, sensors, and complex wiring on the human body are eliminated to improve wearing convenience. A comparison experiment shows that this method produces close output to a motion analysis system with different subjects in different motion.

As such, we replaced the prescribed target knee motion by an automat- ically generated proﬁle based on the intact knee. As the proﬁle of the intact knee varies over time due to human adaptation, we are presented with a challenging tracking control problem in the context of classical control theory. By formulating the “echo control” of the robotic knee as a reinforcement learning problem, we provide a promising new tool for real-time tracking control design without explicitly representing the underlying dynamics using a mathematical model, which can be difﬁcult to obtain for a human-robot system.

This device utilizes a power-asymmetric linear actuator to provide the desired functionality in a com- pact and lightweight package through a combination of both hydraulic and electromechanical actuation approaches. The device is controlled for level ground walking via a ﬁnite- state machine. The functionality of the prosthesis is demon- strated by a set of benchtop experiments that characterize the ability of the prosthesis to provide the three desired be- haviors and by an experiment in which the prosthesis was worn by a transtibial amputee during walking. Both sets of experiments indicate that the prosthesis provides the func- tionality for which it was designed.  available at low to moderate cost.

The goal of this paper is to design and establish clinical feasibility of an ankle exoskeleton control strategy that instantly and appropriately adjusts assistance to the changing biomechanical demand dur- ing variable walking. To accomplish this goal, we devel- joint-moment control strategy that oped a proportional prescribes assistance as a function of the instantaneous estimate of the ankle joint moment and conducted a laboratory-based feasibility study. Four individuals with neuromotor impairment and one unimpaired individual completed exoskeleton-assisted slow and fast gait transi- tion tasks that involved gait initiation and changing walk- ing speed. We found that the controller was effective in instantaneously prescribing exoskeleton assistance that was proportional to the ankle moment with less than 14% root-mean-square error, on average. We also performed a three-subject pilot investigation to determine the ability of the proportionaljoint-momentcontrollerto improvewalking economy. Evaluated in two individuals with cerebral palsy and one unimpaired individual, metabolic cost of trans- port improved 17–27% during treadmill and over-ground walking with proportional control compared with wear- ing the exoskeleton unassisted.

Young  Abstract—Estimating biological joint moments using wearable sensors could enable out-of-lab biomechanical analyses and exoskeletons that assist throughout daily life. To realize these possibilities, this study introduced a subject-independent hip moment estimator using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) and validated its performance and generalizability during multimodal ambulation. Electrogoniometer and simulated IMU data from sixteen participants walking on level ground, ramps and stairs were used to evaluate our approach when benchmarked against a fully-connected neural network, a long short-term memory network, and a baseline method (i.e., using subject- average moment curves based on ambulation mode and gait phase). Additionally, the generalizability of our approach was evaluated by testing on ground slopes, stair heights, and gait training. The TCN transitions withheld during model outperformed the benchmark approaches on the hold-out data (p<0.05), with an average RMSE of 0.131±0.018 Nm\/kg and R2 of 0.880±0.030 during steady-state ambulation. When tested on the 20 leave-one-out slope and stair height conditions, the TCN significantly increased RMSE only on the steepest (+18°) incline (p<0.05). Finally, the TCN RMSE and R2 was 0.152±0.027 Nm\/kg and 0.786±0.055, respectively, during mode transitions. Thus, our approach accurately estimated hip moment and generalized to unseen gait contexts using data from three wearable sensors.

Sarkisian, Marshall K. Ishmael, Grace R. Hunt, and Tommaso Lenzi, Member, IEEE  Abstract— Powered knee exoskeletons aim to assist individuals with lower limb impairments by providing power and torque at the joint level. However, if the anatomical and exoskeleton joints are not perfectly aligned, the exoskeleton assistance may result in spurious forces and torques transferred to the user’s limb. These spurious forces and torques can then generate undesired loads on the user’s joint and shear stress on the user’s skin, causing pain and ultimately undermining the exoskeleton assistance. To address this issue, we propose a novel powered knee exoskeleton with a self-aligning mechanism using a prismatic-revolute- revolute (PRR) configuration. The proposed self-aligning mechanism weighs 190 g (i.e., 5.3% of the total exoskeleton weight) and can transmit up to 120 Nm of torque at the knee joint (i.e., biological peak torque for a 50th percentile male climbing stairs). Our experiments show that during assisted sit-to-stand transfers the peaks of the spurious torques and forces are below 0.5 Nm and 5 N, respectively, even if misalignments are intentionally added between the user and the exoskeleton. This study supports the use of self-aligning mechanisms in powered exoskeletons.  are neglected, perfect static alignment between the powered and anatomical axes is not possible as the anatomical axis cannot be located accurately when wearing the powered exoskeleton. Finally, a perfectly aligned exoskeleton may become misaligned due to the compression of the user’s soft tissues or flexibility of the human-robot interface generated by the interaction forces between the user and the exoskeleton [8].","id":"61256b5a-e81b-4789-b4ab-427c5ae7b13f"}

The main aim of this study is to measure the forces during the walking movement in left and right part of patello femoral joint for OA patients and normal subjects. The objective is to design a circuit to measure forces and to test the difference between OA patients and normal subjects. The hardware circuit was designed using NI ELVIS ( National Instrument Educational Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Suite), which is used to interface the sensors with the labVIEW software. The labVIEW software is used to acquire data from the sensors. The circuit was designed using two FSR sensors (Force Sensitive Resistor) which are fitted to the upper part of the patellofemoral joint on right and left knee separately. The forces which are obtained by the walking movement within the duration of three minutes. The measured output shows a decrement in force compare to normal and OA subjects and it also has been identified that right knee force is greater than left knee force .

Based on this passive dynamics of human locomotion, we develop an energy-efﬁcient braking torque controller for a robotic transtibial prosthesis. The con- troller ﬁrst generates motor current\/torque from human locomotion instead of the battery energy, and then controls the current\/torque with alternating current sensing and voltage-controlled-resistor. On the basis of the low-level motor torque controller, we then propose the impedance model that determines the desired joint torque according to the joint angle and joint velocity, the prosthesis model that converts the desired ankle joint torque to desired motor torque, and the friction model that estimates the friction torque and compensates the joint torque. Step response and frequency response show that the low-level controller can reach the desired torque value within 0.07 s, and has a −3 dB bandwidth of 25.2 Hz. Experiments of level-ground treadmill walking with three amputees show that the pros- thesis with the proposed controller can effectively mimic the normal ankle performance and bring the amputees a natural gait pattern with low power consumption.

One potential solution is to detect these changing walking conditions online using Bayesian state estimation to deliver assistance that continuously adapts to the wearer’s gait.

Although several squat assistance methods are available,the effect of personalizedassistance on physical effort has not been examined. We hypothesize that personalized assistance will reduce the physical effort of squatting. We developed a human-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization scheme to minimize the metabolic cost of squatting using a unilateral ankle exoskeleton. The opti- mization identiﬁed subject-speciﬁc assistance parameters for ascending and descending during squatting and took 15.8 min on average to converge. The subject-speciﬁc optimized condition reduced metabolic cost by 19.9% and rectus femoris muscle activity by 28.7% compared to the condition without the exoskeleton with a higher probability of improvement compared to a generic condition. In an additional study with two participants, the personalized condition presented higher metabolic cost reduction than the genericcondition.Thesereductionsillustratethe impor- tance of personalized ankle assistance using an exoskele- tonforsquatting,aphysicallyintensiveactivity,andsuggest that such a method can be applied to minimize the physical effort of squatting.

One of the reasons for the posture is fatigue [7], [8], which is partially caused by increased physical effort [9], [10], typically measured by metabolic cost [11]. Squat assistance from an exoskeleton has the potential to reduce squat effort, and perhaps reduce fatigue, maintain correct posture, and reduce related injuries.","id":"749b7a5b-c961-4a52-b1d6-a5fd778f02de"}

Robertson, Jean-Marie J. Wilson, and Taunya A. St. Pierre University of Ottawa  The purpose of this research was to determine the functions of the gluteus maximus, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior muscles about their associated joints during full (deep-knee) squats. Muscle func- tion was determined from joint kinematics, inverse dynamics, electromyography, and muscle length changes. The subjects were six experienced, male weight lifters. Analyses revealed that the prime movers during ascent were the monoarticular gluteus maximus and vasti muscles (as exemplified by vastus latera- lis) and to a lesser extent the soleus muscles. The biarticular muscles functioned mainly as stabilizers of the ankle, knee, and hip joints by working eccentrically to control descent or transferring energy among the segments during ascent. During the ascent phase, the hip exten- sor moments of force produced the largest powers followed by the ankle plantar flexors and then the knee extensors. The hip and knee extensors provided the initial bursts of power during ascent with the ankle extensors and especially a second burst from the hip exten- sors adding power during the latter half of the ascent.

Fylstra1,2†, I‑Chieh Lee1,2†, Minhan Li1,2, Michael D. Lewek3 and He Huang1,2*  Abstract Background: Personalizing prosthesis control is often structured as human‑in‑the‑loop optimization. However, gait performance is influenced by both human control and intelligent prosthesis control. Hence, we need to consider both human and prosthesis control, and their cooperation, to achieve desired gait patterns. In this study, we devel‑ oped a novel paradigm that engages human gait control via user‑fed visual feedback (FB) of stance time to cooperate with automatic prosthesis control tuning. Three initial questions were studied: (1) does user control of gait timing (via visual FB) help the prosthesis tuning algorithm to converge faster? (2) in turn, does the prosthesis control influence the user’s ability to reach and maintain the target stance time defined by the feedback? and (3) does the prosthesis control parameters tuned with extended stance time on prosthesis side allow the user to maintain this potentially beneficial behavior even after feedback is removed (short‑ and long‑term retention)?  Methods: A reinforcement learning algorithm was used to achieve prosthesis control to meet normative knee kinematics in walking. A visual FB system cued the user to control prosthesis‑side stance time to facilitate the pros‑ thesis tuning goal. Seven individuals without amputation (AB) and four individuals with transfemoral amputation (TFA) walked with a powered knee prosthesis on a treadmill. Participants completed prosthesis auto‑tuning with three visual feedback conditions: no FB, self‑selected stance time FB (SS FB), and increased stance time FB (Inc FB).

Taha Ahmad1,2, and Robert D. Gregg2,3  Abstract—This paper presents the mechatronic design and initial validation of a partial-assist knee orthosis for individuals with musculoskeletal disorders, e.g., knee osteoarthritis and lower back pain. This orthosis utilizes a quasi-direct drive ac- tuator with a low-ratio transmission (7:1) to greatly reduce the reﬂected inertia for high backdrivability. To provide meaningful assistance, a custom Brushless DC (BLDC) motor is designed with encapsulated windings to improve the motor’s thermal environment and thus its continuous torque output. The 2.69 kg orthosis is constructed from all custom-made components with a high package factor for lighter weight and a more compact size. The combination of compactness, backdrivability, and torque output enables the orthosis to provide partial assistance without obstructing the natural movement of the user. Several benchtop tests verify the actuator’s capabilities, and a human subject experiment demonstrates reduced quadriceps muscle activation when assisted during a repetitive lifting and lowering task.  I. INTRODUCTION  Traditionally, exoskeletons (i.e., powered orthoses) aid paraplegic individuals with little to no remnant voluntary movement, e.g., following a severe stroke or spinal cord injury [1], [2]. As a result, many exoskeleton designs have focused on achieving high torque output to fully support the lower extremities. However, larger populations of individuals with musculoskeletal disorders would beneﬁt from partial assistance of their musculature rather than full assistance. This includes 27 million individuals with osteoarthritis [3] and 66 million individuals with lower back pain [4] in the USA alone. Weak quadriceps musculature is a signiﬁcant contributing factor to the persistence and progression of both conditions, a limitation that can potentially be resolved by assistive knee torques. In the case of knee osteoarthritis, the this assistance would in turn reduce high forces at patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints, ultimately reducing pain [5], [6]. Likewise, lower back pain that results from repetitive lifting and lowering (L&L) tasks could poten- tially beneﬁt from partial assistance, as fatigued quadriceps contribute to poor posture in these tasks [7]. To achieve partial assistance, several design goals must be balanced: 1) facilitation of non-hindered voluntary movement of the user","id":"854a29f0-1c94-4e56-baae-6e620cc5b991"}

Thus, we expect that the negative effect of the added mass will be lower for a powered hip exoskeleton than a powered ankle and knee prosthesis. Consequently, residual-hip assistance may more easily lead to a net reduction of metabolic effort.

The purpose of this study was to test whether a passive spring-loaded ankle exoskeleton could reduce the mechanical and energetic demands of bilateral hopping on the musculoskeletal sys- tem. Joint level kinematics and kinetics were collected with electro- myographic and metabolic energy consumption data for seven partic- ipants hopping at four frequencies (2.2, 2.5, 2.8, and 3.2 Hz). Hopping was performed without an exoskeleton; with an springless exoskele- ton; and with a spring-loaded exoskeleton. Spring-loaded ankle exo- skeletons reduced plantar ﬂexor muscle activity and the biological contribution to ankle joint moment (15–25%) and average positive power (20–40%). They also facilitated reductions in metabolic power (15–20%) across frequencies from 2.2 to 2.8 Hz compared with hopping with a springless exoskeleton. Reductions in metabolic power compared with hopping with no exoskeleton were restricted to hop- ping at 2.5 Hz only (12%). These results highlighted the importance of reducing the rate of muscular force production and work to achieve metabolic reductions. They also highlighted the importance of assist- ing muscles acting at the knee joint. Exoskeleton designs may need to be tuned to optimize exoskeleton mass, spring stiffness, and spring slack length to achieve greater metabolic reductions.","id":"dc88c203-1c92-4f80-8618-3d5f7a21c993"}

Equinus is common in children with cerebral palsy; as such, children ages 5-12 are the intended users of the device. Equinus is a condition in which the patient’s ankle motion is restricted. As a result, gait becomes awkward and inefficient, and the propulsive force a typical human body would receive from ankle motion is significantly reduced or lost completely. Patients with equinus tend to develop detrimental gait patterns, most notably toe-walking. Improving their gait with an assistive device should help these patients manage their condition.  The goal of improving gait was accomplished by designing an exoskeleton device that provided an assistive propulsive force to the patient’s foot. To begin the design process, customer needs were outlined, based on requirements and specifications provided by the client, Dr. Zachary Lerner (the director of NAU’s Biomechatronics Lab). Engineering requirements were then developed to meet the customer needs.

This high metabolic cost may be explained by the inability of available passive prostheses to replicate the biomechanics of intact legs during walking. Powered prostheses promise to address this issue by imitating the power generation of intact legs. Several studies have investigated the effect of power generation and energy injection at the ankle joint in transtibial amputees. In contrast, no study has directly addressed knee power generation in transfemoral amputees. This study investigates the effect of knee power generation in late stance in one transfemoral amputee subject using a lightweight powered prosthesis. Experimental results suggest that injecting positive energy into the gait cycle at the knee level may improve gait ability by reducing effort. I. INTRODUCTION Lower-limb amputation affects mobility and causes secondary health effects such as back pain and osteoarthritis [1]. Experimental studies show that amputees expend significantly more energy than able-bodied individuals to ambulate due to the compensatory movements that are required, for example, to accelerate their center of mass forward [2]. These issues can largely be attributed to the limitations of most prosthesis technologies, which rely on passive components such as mechanical springs and dampers, therefore are unable to actively generate power and inject energy into the gait cycle as intact legs would [3]. These limitations are being addressed by using battery-operated servomotors that can actively regulate joint torque and energy to more closely imitate the biomechanics of intact legs. Able-bodied studies suggest that positive power is a crucial part of the gait cycle [3]. Positive power provides energy to accelerate the body’s center of mass forward at the end of stance as well as to accelerate the leg into swing, thus providing clearance and preparing the leg for the next step. Focusing on the knee joint, both positive and negative power phases occur in stance phase [4]. When the body weight is accepted after heel-strike, power is absorbed by the knee flexion. This negative energy is then returned to positive energy as the knee transitions to extension in mid-stance. In late stance, the knee generates positive power to initiate knee flexion and accelerate the leg into swing.

A soft assistive ankle device, or exosuit, reduced metabolic cost by 10% compared to walking with the device applying no assistance in individuals with chronic stroke [2]. The device applied predefined active plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance on the paretic side.  A different unilateral ankle plantarflexion device, or exoskeleton, has been shown to decrease metabolic energy consumption by about 24% compared to walking with the device applying no assistance in able- bodied individuals with human-in-the-loop optimization [3], [4]. Human-in-the-loop optimization identifies user specific assistance strategies in real time based on biological measurements of the user.  Research Question  Does customized assistance significantly reduce the metabolic cost of walking in one participant with chronic stroke using our active plantarflexion exoskeleton with added passive dorsiflexion assistance?  Methods  One individual with hemiparesis (male, age 74, 38 months post-stroke) walked on a treadmill at a self- selected speed wearing an ankle exoskeleton on the paretic leg while the optimizer worked to find a customized assistance strategy. The optimizer relied on a genetic algorithm where the best assistance strategies from one generation inform the next generation of strategies to be sampled.  Device assistance was optimized over four days of walking. The participant completed four generations during the first two days. The participant was then further trained to more effectively use the device. Optimization was restarted, and three generations and a validation test were conducted over the last two days.

In this paper we introduce the concept of an energy-recycling actuator, which uses an array of springs and clutches to capture and return elastic energy in parallel with an electric motor. Engaging and disengaging clutches ap- propriately could reduce electrical energy consumption without sacriﬁcing controllability, but presents a challenging control problem. We formulated the optimal control objective of minimizing actuator power consumption as a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) and solved for the global minimum. For a given actuator design and a wide range of simulated torque and rotation patterns, all corresponding to zero net work over one cycle, we compared optimized actuator energy consumption to that of an optimized gear motor with simple parallel elasticity. The simulated energy-recycling actuator con- sumed less electrical energy: 57% less on average and 80% less in the best case. These results demonstrate an effective approach to optimal control of this type of system, and suggest that energy-recycling actuators could substantially reduce power consumption in some robotics applications.

The purpose of this study was to define any differences in biomechanical gait parameters between patients with MS and healthy controls. A total of 31 MS patients and 31 healthy controls were evaluated: joint torques and joint powers were calculated at the ankle, knee, and hip during the stance phase of gait. The self-selected walking velocity was used as a covariate in the analysis to ensure that group differences were not due to differences in walking velocity between the MS and healthy control groups. Reduced angular range, less joint torque, and reduced joint power were seen in patients with MS. We also found significant correlations between biomechanical gait parameters and EDSS score, which provides a clinical rating of disease severity.

EXOSKELETONS  Removing energy with an exoskeleton reduces the metabolic cost of walking  Michael Shepertycky1*, Sarah Burton2, Andrew Dickson2, Yan-Fei Liu2, Qingguo Li1*  Evolutionary pressures have led humans to walk in a highly efficient manner that conserves energy, making it difficult for exoskeletons to reduce the metabolic cost of walking. Despite the challenge, some exoskeletons have managed to lessen the metabolic expenditure of walking, either by adding or storing and returning energy. We show that the use of an exoskeleton that strategically removes kinetic energy during the swing period of the gait cycle reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 2.5 ± 0.8% for healthy male users while converting the removed energy into 0.25 ± 0.02 watts of electrical power.

Walsh, Member, IEEE  Abstract In this paper, we present the design and characterization of the ExoBoot, a soft inflatable robotic boot for assisting ankle plantarflexion during walking. The ExoBoot integrates a soft textile-based actuator and an IMU sensor into a textile boot, making it low-profile and lightweight. The inflatable actuator generates assistive plantarflexion torque when pressurized by bending on top of the boot. We characterize the torque generated by the ExoBoot at various pressures and ankle angles, achieving a maximum torque of 39 Nm at 483 kPa (70 psi) and 60 degrees ankle angle. In order to evaluate the performance of the ExoBoot during walking, a pilot study with one healthy subject was conducted. Actuation is triggered by an open loop pressure controller, based on the ankle angular velocity measured by an IMU, using high flow rate solenoid valves. At the peak of active assistance, pressure in the actuator reaches 75% of the supply pressure, and maximum torque applied on the ankle is estimated to be 23 Nm.

Cable transmission allows the heavier components to be worn on a more proximal body location such as the waist so that added inertia to the body can be minimized. However, this approach, when combined with interfacing to the body via functional apparel anchors, presents technical challenges in delivering comfortable and controlled assistance to the wearer.  Another approach explored by some groups for the development of lightweight wearable robots is the use of pneumatic or fluid-powered systems. This approach also enables power to be transmitted remotely so that components on the limb can be lightweight. One of the most common types of pneumatic actuator used in wearable robots is the McKibben actuator, which contracts when inflated and display force-length properties similar to those of skeletal muscles [11], [13], [14]. McKibben actuators are both compliant and able to generate large force, but a major caveat comes from their limited stroke length. Thus, when attached across a joint, these actuators can place constraints on the  motion.","id":"4471fdf0-830a-4c6a-9c64-cdd03453bbc1"}

Wearable robotics provide the chance to increase mobility and thus independence. A powered soft exosuit was designed that assist with both ankle plantarﬂexion and hip ﬂexion through a multi-articular suit architecture. So far, the best method to reduce meta- bolic cost of human walking with external forces is unknown. Two basic control strategies are compared in this study: an ankle moment inspired controller (AMIC) and an ankle positive power inspired controller (APIC). Both controllers provided a similar amount of average positive exosuit power and reduced the net metabolic cost of walking by 15 %. These results suggest that average positive power could be more important than assistive moment during single stance for reducing metabolic cost.

Kuo  Abstract—Unilateral lower-limb amputees exhibit asymmetry in many gait features, such as ground force, step time, step length, and joint mechanics. Although these asymmetries result from weak prosthetic-side push-off, there is no proven mechanistic explanation of how that impairment propagates to the rest of the body. We used a simple dynamic walking model to explore possible consequences of a unilateral impairment similar to that of a transtibial amputee. The model compensates for reduced push-off work from one leg by performing more work elsewhere, for example during the middle of stance by either or both legs. The model predicts several gait abnormalities, including slower forward velocity of the body center-of-mass during intact-side stance, greater energy dissipation in the intact side, and more positive work overall. We tested these predictions with data from unilateral transtibial amputees (N = 11) and nonamputee control subjects (N = 10) walking on an instrumented treadmill. We ob- served several predicted asymmetries, including forward velocity during stance phases and energy dissipation from the two limbs, as well as greater work overall. Secondary adaptations, such as to reduce discomfort, may exacerbate asymmetry, but these simple principles suggest that some asymmetry may be unavoidable in cases of unilateral limb loss.

A mechanistic study of the fundamental effects of unilateral limb loss and strategies for compensating for this loss might yield insights regarding asymmetric gait.","id":"ac58087e-881f-4a05-bcfb-732cb4ff14f5"}

The controller was implemented on a mono-articular soft exosuit coupled to a lab-based multi-joint actuation platform that enables rapid reconfiguration of different sensors and control strategy implementation. The controller design is motivated by a model of the suit-human interface and utilizes an iterative control methodology that includes gait detection and step-by-step actuator position profile generation to control the onset timing, peak timing, and peak magnitude of the delivered force. This controller was evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.5 m\/s while carrying a load of 23 kg. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across subjects. Specifically, for a given profile, the average delivered force started concurrently with the timing of the maximum hip flexion angle and reached its peak timing 22.7 ± 0.63% later in the gait cycle (desired 23%) with a peak magnitude of 198.2 ± 1.6 N (desired 200 N), equivalent to an average peak torque of 30.5 ± 4.7 Nm.

INTRODUCTION Many people wish to perform at a high level while playing an active role in sports. Interest in enabling the disabled and the elderly to participate in sports has increased in recent years. Universal sports and superhuman sports that enable everyone to play in the same competition regardless of the presence or absence of a disability, age difference, or gender has also attracted increased attention. However, to be active in sports, it is necessary for players to condition their physical capability and technique with daily training. Active motion assist devices are currently being actively developed. These devices are of two types: active type [1-3], which is equipped with actuators; and passive type [4-6], which uses spring elements. In the active type, it is necessary to mount an energy source (for example, a battery, a compressed gas tank, or a compressor) that drives the actuator while achieving a strong assisting force by the actuator and performing fine control. This makes the overall system bulky and heavy, and also incurs high maintenance costs. The passive type is inexpensive and lightweight. However, the assist power generated by current passive assist devices is not sufficiently large to aid participants in sports. Further, the spring elements sometimes disrupt the wearer’s motion because they always generate force, and provide resistive force in certain cases","id":"c3c895c8-7ae1-4b34-a8e9-e9390627b1c2"}

Abstract—Neuromuscular impairment associated with cere- bral palsy (CP) often leads to life-long walking deﬁcits. Our goal was to evaluate the ability of a novel untethered wearable ankle exoskeleton to reduce the severity of gait pathology from CP. In this clinical feasibility study of ﬁve individuals with CP, we used instrumented gait analysis to quantify how powered plantar-ﬂexor assistance affected gait mechanics following multi-visit acclimation. Compared to how each participant walked normally, walking with unteth- ered exoskeleton assistance resulted in improved ankle plantar-ﬂexion and knee extension; residual ﬂexion deformity across the lower-extremity improved by a clinically signif- icant 14.4 (p = 0.022). Powered plantar-ﬂexor assistance increased average total positive ankle power by 44% (p = 0.037), and resulted in a 30% reduction in average negative biological ankle power (p = 0.004) and a 29% reduction in average positive hip power (p = 0.009). These ﬁndings suggest that powered ankle assistance augmented, rather than simply replaced, biological function to produce a more efﬁcient gait pattern, which was corroborated by a 19% improvement in metabolic cost of transport (p = 0.011). This study provides evidence in support of the continued investigation of ankle assistance in mobility and rehabilita- tion interventions for this patient population.

The mechanical and electrical conﬁguration and the controller can be personalized to accommodate differences in impairments among individ- uals with spinal cord injuries (SCI). In hardware, this per- sonalization is accomplished by a modular approach that allows the reconﬁguration of a lower-limb exoskeleton with ultimately eight powered series actuated (SEA) joints and high ﬁdelity torque control. For SCI individuals with an incomplete lesion and sufﬁcient hip control, we applied a trajectory-free neuromuscular control (NMC) strategy and used the exoskeleton in the ankle-knee conﬁguration. For complete SCI individuals, we used a combination of a NMC and an impedance based trajectory tracking strategy with theexoskeletonintheankle-knee-hipconﬁguration.Results of a preliminary evaluation of the developed hardware and software showed that SCI individuals with an incomplete lesion could naturally vary their walking speed and step length and walked faster compared to walking without the device.

To realize steady walk on stairs, the most important problem is the structure design and gait planning of lower limb exoskeleton. A novel assisted exoskeleton system was proposed based on biomechanics characteristics. The four-point segmented gait generation strategy based on cubic spline interpolation was proposed, and the gait trajectory during stair walking was described. To ensure walking stability, the constraint relationship between the swing leg and the stair step was constructed. In addition, the constraint function was constructed for stable walking in horizontal and vertical directions based on zero moment point (ZMP). Then, the multicoupled continuous dynamic primitive gait learning strategy (PIRDMPs) was proposed to achieve fine-grained learning of stair gait trajectories. Finally, the proposed method was validated by human–machine wear experiments. Compared with the dynamic motion primitive (DMP) method, the average trajectory fits for the hip and knee joints obtained based on the PIRDMPs method were increased by 11.28% and 7.17%, respectively. Also, the average deviation values of ZMP in the sagittal plane (ZMP-X) and coronal plane (ZMP-Y) of the man–machine system were reduced by 109.2 and 125.3 mm, respectively.

However, EMG is a noisy signal which can vary over time, giving rise to the question what approach for knee torque estimation is most suitable for multi-day control. In this study we compared three different modelling frameworks to estimate knee torque in non-weight-bearing situations. The ﬁrst model contained a convolutional neural network (CNN) which mapped EMG to knee torque directly. The second used a neuromusculoskeletal model (NMS) which used EMG, muscle tendon unit lengths and moment arms to compute knee torque. The third model (Hybrid) used a CNN to map EMG to speciﬁc muscle activation, which was used together with NMS components to compute knee torque. Multi-day measurements were conducted on ten able-bodied participants who performed non-weight bearing activities. CNN had the best performance in general and on each day (Normalized Root Mean Squared (NRMSE 12.4 ± 3.4%) was able to Error (NRMSE) 9.2 ± 4.4%). The Hybrid model outperform NMS (NRMSE 14.3 ± 4.2%). The NMS model showed no signiﬁcant difference between measurement days. The CNN model and Hybrid models had signiﬁcant performance differences between the ﬁrst day and all other days. CNNs are suited for multi-day torque estimation in terms of error rate, outperforming the other two model types. NMS was the only model type which was robust over all days. This study investigated the behavior of three model types over multiple days, giving insight in the most suited modelling approach for multi-day torque estimation to be used in prosthetic control.","id":"0191015a-3713-4073-9228-415f26311aa0"}

The typical weight burden often exceeds 40 kg which is beyond the recommended maximum load limits which lead to acute and chronic musculoskeletal injuries. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of a new device called “Dermoskeleton” designed to counterpart the acute and chronic impacts of the distributed overload bearing of dismounted soldiers in all their tasks, e.g. marching and fighting modes. The performance of the initial prototypes was evaluated experimentally using standardized quantitative aerobic and anaerobic tests. The evaluation protocol included two conditions (with and without the device), with three weight criteria (no weight, 25 lbs, 50 lbs), and three (3) short\/intense exercises tests: 1) performing the maximum amount of squats possible, 2) continuously climbing 3 flights of stairs for a period of 20 minutes and 3) conducting the Canadian Home Fitness Test (CHFT). The results showed a significant mechanical advantage (i.e. 48%) during the squat test. The current proof-of-concept prototype did not show a physiological benefit for stair climbing tasks but for one (1) participant. During the CHFT, the physiological effort with the device raised at about 5% to 10%. However, the participants perceived less physically exerting while loaded when using the dermoskeleton. The participants also noted that the system had considerable potential to enhance soldier mobility and reduce musculo-skeletal demands if key attributes of the system could be improved.  1.0 INTRODUCTION  1.1 The Challenge","id":"187abd90-7531-48a2-a6e8-4424786e6898"}

Abstract: Cycling stands as one of the most widely embraced leisure activities and serves purposes such as exercise, rehabilitation, and commuting. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of assisting three unimpaired participants (age: 34.0 ± 7.9 years, height: 1.86 ± 0.02 m, weight: 75.7 ± 12.7 kg) using the GuroX hip exoskeleton, originally designed for walking assistance, during cycling against a resistance of 1W\/kg. The performance evaluation employed a sweep protocol that manipulated the timing of the exoskeleton’s peak extension and flexion torque in addition to human-in-the-loop optimization to enhance these timings based on metabolic cost. Our findings indicate that with a peak assistance torque of approximately 10.3Nm for extension and flexion, the GuroX substantially reduced the net metabolic cost of cycling by 31.4 ± 8.1% and 26.4 ± 14.1% compared to transparent and without exoskeleton conditions, respectively. This demonstrates the significant potential of a hip exoskeleton developed for walking assistance to profoundly benefit cycling. Additionally, customizing the assistance strategy proves beneficial in maximizing assistance. While we attribute the average motor power to be a major contributor to the reduced cycling effort, participant feedback suggests that user comfort and synchronization between the user and exoskeleton may have played integral roles. Further research should validate our initial findings by employing a larger participant pool in real-world conditions. Incorporating a more diverse set of parameters for the human-in-the- loop optimization could enhance individualized assistance strategies.

Murray 外骨骼被动动力学 主动补偿控制","content":" Abstract— The authors intend to utilize a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance in individuals with lower limb neuromuscular deficit. The authors suggest that two foundational elements are required to do so effectively. First, the exoskeleton system must be capable of reliable real-time gait phase detection, in order to determine the nature of gait assistance to provide. Second, in gait phases or circumstances in which the exoskeleton provides minimal assistance, the passive dynamics of the exoskeleton should not hinder the individual (i.e., should have the capability to minimally interfere with gait dynamics). As such, the exoskeleton system should be capable of actively compensating for its passive dynamics, namely the inertial, gravitational, and frictional effects it imposes on the user. This paper describes the implementation of these two foundational elements (real-time gait phase detection and active cancellation of passive dynamics) on a prototype lower limb exoskeleton, and provides experimental data demonstrating their respective efficacy. I. INTRODUCTION A number of neuromuscular impairments result in acute and\/or chronic locomotor deficits. Common conditions resulting in gait deficit or impairment include incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy (CP), multiple sclerosis (MS), and complications resulting from cerebral vascular accident (stroke). There are approximately 260,000 persons in the US with SCI, approximately one half of which are incomplete injuries [1]; there are approximately 765,000 individuals in the US with CP [2]; and there are approximately 350,000 individuals in the US with MS [3]. Collectively, there are approximately 1.3 million persons in the US living with one of these conditions. Further, there are approximately 7 million persons living in the US who have experienced a cerebral vascular accident (stroke) [4], and a significant portion of these have or have had gait impairment as a result. The authors are developing a lower limb exoskeleton for gait assistance in individuals with lower limb neuromuscular deficit, such as individuals in those populations previously cited.

The prosthesis and controller enable users to perform both step-over and step-to stair ascent and descent. The efficacy of the controller and SCSA prosthesis prototype in providing improved stair ambulation was tested on a unilateral transfemoral amputee in experiments that employed motion capture apparatus to compare joint kinematics with the SCSA prosthesis, relative to performing the same activity with a microprocessor-controlled daily-use passive prosthesis. Results suggest that the SCSA knee significantly decreases compensatory motion during stair activity when compared to the passive prosthesis. I. INTRODUCTION Many tasks of daily living are often more difficult for persons with transfemoral amputation than for their age-matched non-amputee counterparts [1, 2]. One task frequently performed either in the home or in daily life which has been shown to be exceptionally difficult for persons with amputation is traversing stairs [3]. Perhaps the most common type of knee prosthesis which provides stair ambulation capability is a microprocessor-controlled knee (MPK). MPKs incorporate stance control via modulated dampers that dissipate energy and thus provide controlled stance-knee yielding during stair descent. Such devices are capable of providing good step-to or step-over stair descent functionality. Although MPKs can provide adequate stair descent functionality, they are more limited in their ability to provide stair ascent functionality, due to two essential limitations: lack of active knee extension during stance phase, and lack of swing control during swing phase. The first assists during the stance phase of stair ascent in which the body center-of-mass is lifted, while the second guides the swing foot over the subsequent stair riser and onto the tread during the swing phase. The first of these limitations is less fundamental than the second. Specifically, in stance phase, an amputee can provide stance knee extension via hip extension. In swing phase, however, an amputee cannot directly provide a desired knee motion via hip effort. Specifically, a passive transfemoral prosthesis (e.g., an MPK) can be thought of as a double link pendulum with an actuated revolute joint at the hip and unactuated revolute joint at the knee. As shown in Fig.1, when in stance phase, the foot of the prosthesis is grounded, and as such the leg is fully controllable by the hip (i.e","id":"b5faa9e5-161c-43c7-923c-8ffbdb0cfa57"}

The purpose of this study was to define any differences in biomechanical gait parameters between patients with MS and healthy controls. A total of 31 MS patients and 31 healthy controls were evaluated: joint torques and joint powers were calculated at the ankle, knee, and hip during the stance phase of gait. The self-selected walking velocity was used as a covariate in the analysis to ensure that group differences were not due to differences in walking velocity between the MS and healthy control groups. Reduced angular range, less joint torque, and reduced joint power were seen in patients with MS. We also found significant correlations between biomechanical gait parameters and EDSS score, which provides a clinical rating of disease severity. Our findings provide a quantitative assessment of the gait mechanics employed in patients with MS. The altered lower extremity mechanics observed in patients with MS reflect both a neurological and strength deficit compared with healthy controls during walking.

In curling, the environmental characteristics change at every moment, and every throw has an impact on the outcome of the match. Furthermore, there is no time for relearning during a curling match due to the timing rules of the game. Here, we report a curling robot that can achieve human-level performance in the game of curling using an adaptive deep reinforcement learning framework. Our proposed adaptation framework extends standard deep reinforcement learning using temporal features, which learn to compensate for the uncer- tainties and nonstationarities that are an unavoidable part of curling. Our curling robot, Curly, was able to win three of four official matches against expert human teams [top-ranked women’s curling teams and Korea national wheelchair curling team (reserve team)]. These results indicate that the gap between physics-based simulators and the real world can be narrowed.

However, no studies have investigated how quickly individuals with neuromuscular disabilities adapt to assistance across different time scales, which makes experimental design challenging. The goal of this case series was to evaluate how individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) adapt to untethered powered plantar-flexor assistance within and across exoskeleton practice sessions. To assess inter-visit adaptation, one participant with mild CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System level (GMFCS) I) completed 112 minutes of exoskeleton walking practice across four visits. This participant’s preferred level of assistance increased across practice sessions, and metabolic assessment indicated reduced acclimation time and improved walking economy; across visits, metabolic cost decreased by 18% during walking with exoskeleton assistance and by 13% while wearing the exoskeleton in an unassisted condition. To assess intra-visit adaptation, another participant with mild CP (GMFCS I) completed three 8-10 minute exoskeleton-assisted walking trials with the same level of assistance on a single visit. This participant exhibited a 16% reduction in the average metabolic cost relative to baseline during the final minute of walking on the third trial. Despite walking with assistance for 30 minutes, the participant did not appear to reach a fully acclimated state at the end of the third trial, suggesting that further improvements may have been observed with additional practice. These preliminary findings may prove useful for designing novel intervention studies and experimental protocols testing the potential benefit of wearable assistance in clinical populations. I. INTRODUCTION Neuromuscular deficits, including those caused by stroke, spinal cord injury, and cerebral palsy (CP), often result in impaired walking ability [1], [2]. Abnormal gait patterns caused by these conditions increase the energy required to walk and are associated with reduced levels of physical activity [3]–[5]. Techniques to improve walking efficiency have the potential to drastically improve the quality of life in these patient populations, particularly for CP, which is a child-onset condition with symptoms that typically worsen with age.

Rouse  1,4,5 ✉  Joint mechanical impedance, which describes the instantaneous relationship between kinematic perturbations and the resulting torque response, plays an important role in the way humans ambulate, interact with the environment, and respond to disturbances. Recent studies have quantified how the stiffness component of mechanical impedance varies during walking. However, the extent to which humans can voluntarily regulate leg joint stiffness is not yet known. Our study sought to quantify the accuracy and precision of the neuromotor system to voluntarily regulate ankle joint stiffness while seated, and compare these data to the well-known abilities to regulate ankle joint torque and position. We tested individuals’ ability to to regulate these quantities at three different magnitudes: 20%, 40%, and 60% of a maximum value. Our results showed that subjects were able to voluntarily regulate ankle joint stiffness, and that the normalized accuracy and precision of stiffness regulation were not different than those of position or torque for targets at magnitudes of 20% of a maximum value. However, the accuracy and precision of stiffness regulation were statistically different than those of position and torque for targets at magnitudes of 40% of the maximum values. At moderate targets, the similarity of the ability to regulate ankle joint stiffness when compared to the abilities to regulate joint torque and position highlights the importance of a comprehensive description of lower-limb biomechanics that includes consideration of joint mechanical impedance, in addition to the common descriptions of joint torque and position.  Our fundamental understanding of how human locomotion is regulated by the neuromuscular system mainly stems from analyses of how the legs are moved during gait (joint angles), and how effort is provided throughout locomotion (joint torques)1. These data have formed the core of locomotor biomechanics for over a century. In addition, this information has many important implications, including serving as a benchmark for diagnosis and treatment of neuromotor pathologies and providing a guide for the development of assistive technologies, among other uses. However, this fundamental biomechanical description of human locomotion is incomplete.","id":"5fd09363-c3c5-4b35-a970-b2bf43efee36"}

Gregg  Abstract—This paper describes the design of a powered knee- and-ankle transfemoral prosthetic leg, which implements high torque density actuators with low-reduction transmissions. The low reduction of the transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible beneﬁts over modern actuation styles implemented in emerging robotic prosthetic legs. Such beneﬁts include free-swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, and greater potential for power regeneration. Benchtop validation experiments were conducted to verify some of these beneﬁts. Backdrive and free- swinging knee tests conﬁrm that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (˜3 Nm). Bandwidth tests reveal that the actuator is capable of achieving frequencies required for walk- ing and running. Lastly, open-loop impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufﬁciently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback.  into the user’s gait. By actively injecting energy into the user’s gait, powered prostheses have the capability to restore mobility and quality of life to those who live with the loss of a limb.  In the last decade, a great amount of research has gone into the design and control of powered prosthetic limbs [6], [7]. Many powered prosthetic devices have emerged from this research, several of which implement non-backdrivable actuators, consisting of high-speed, low-torque motors with high-ratio transmissions, such as ball screws or multiple gear stages [4], [6], [8]–[16]. In the past few years, legged robots such as the quadruped MIT Cheetah [17], biped ATRIAS [18], and others [19] have embraced high-torque motors with low-ratio or no transmissions.

While others have shown positive results, the fundamental question of how the exoskeleton interacts with the human remains unknown. Understanding the optimal as- sistance magnitude is not simply relevant for control, it is a critical knowledge for exoskeleton designers. An accurate understanding of assistance levels will enable the designers to minimize exoskele- ton mass and improve the performance by avoiding excessive ac- tuators and drivetrains. We explored the relationship between the assistance magnitude and the energetic cost beneﬁts by using a series elastic actuator driven powered hip exoskeleton. The ex- oskeleton controller mimics a human biological hip moment to provide the assistance during the gait cycle. Ten able-bodied subjects walked using the exoskeleton with different magnitudes of assistance in both hip ﬂexion and extension. Generally, the result- ing metabolic cost across different assistance conditions showed a U-shape trend which was consistent across all subjects (p < 0.01). The interpreted optimal assistance point through the quadratic ﬁt resulted in a 6% metabolic cost reduction with respect to the no- assistance condition.

Unfortunately, increased weight and size neg- atively affect comfort and socket stability, ultimately lim- iting their clinical viability. Alternatively, a nonbackdrivable transmissionsystemcanbeusedtoactivelyregulatethean- kle position during nonweight bearing activities only.

Thus, available semiactive prostheses are still signiﬁcantly heavier and have a larger build height than passive ankle prostheses. In this paper, we present the design, development, and validation of a semiactive an- kle prosthesis with a nonbackdrivable cam-follower mech- anism designed to lower the load on moving components and align with the foot longitudinally as necessary to reduce the prosthesis weight and size. The proposed ankle mech- anism is ∼50% shorter, has ∼40% wider range of motion (ROM), and is estimated to be ∼27% lighter than available semiactive prostheses. Experiments with a transtibial sub- ject show that the semiactive prosthesis can increase foot clearance up to 142% and reduce the load on the residual limb as low as 32% compared to passive prostheses.

While some single-joint exoskeletons have assisted incline walking, recent successes in level-ground assistance suggest that greater improvements may be possible by optimizing assistance of the whole leg. To understand how ex- oskeleton assistance should change with incline, we used human- in-the-loop optimization to find whole-leg exoskeleton assistance torques that minimized metabolic cost on a range of grades. We optimized assistance for three able-bodied, expert participants on 5 degree, 10 degree, and 15 degree inclines using a hip-knee- ankle exoskeleton emulator. For all assisted conditions, the cost of transport was reduced by at least 50% relative to walking in the device with no assistance, which is a large improvement to walking comparable to the benefits of whole-leg assistance on level-ground (N = 3). Optimized extension torque magnitudes and exoskeleton power increased with incline. Hip extension, knee extension and ankle plantarflexion often grew as large as allowed by comfort-based limits. Applied powers on steep inclines were double the powers applied during level-ground walking, indicating that greater exoskeleton power may be optimal in scenarios where biological powers and costs are higher. Future exoskeleton devices could deliver large improvements in walking performance across a range of inclines if they have sufficient torque and power capabilities.

Numerous studies discuss the design and control of various exoskeleton mechanisms, yet rela- tively few address the effect on the energy expenditure of the user. In this paper we report the effects of using a knee exoskeleton on the metabolic cost of periodic squatting. By measur- ing oxygen consumption, minute ventilation, heart rate, blood oxygenation and EMG signals during 5 minute squatting series, with a frequency of one squat every 2 seconds, we show the effects of using the knee exoskeleton under three different control methods: gravity compensa- tion approach, oscillator based approach and position based approach. Statistically signiﬁcant differences in physiological responses emerge when using the knee exoskeleton under gravity compensation and oscillator based control. On the other hand, effects of position based control cannot be deemed statistically signiﬁcant.  Keywords. exoskeleton, knee, squatting, metabolic cost, K4  1.

Assisting hip extension with a tethered exosuit and a simulation-optimized force profile reduces metabolic cost of running.  Through evolution, our human species has become remarkably good at distance running thanks to long spring-like tendons in the legs and hairless skin for optimal thermoregulation. Studies have shown that distance running per- formance is linearly correlated with metabolic cost, and there has been an increased interest in the robotics community to develop wear- able exoskeletons to further augment human performance by reducing metabolic cost.  The past 3 years have seen exciting break- throughs in exoskeletons that are able to reduce the metabolic cost of walking (1–4); however, to date, efforts to develop exoskel- etons that assist running have been limited, and initial studies have not yet been able to dem - onstrate reductions in metabolic cost (5, 6). One of the challenges with developing exo- skeletons to assist running is that biological joint work in running is greater than in walk- ing. Another challenge is that the metabolic cost of carrying weight at the waist or distal- ly is higher during running than during walk- ing; therefore, the metabolic penalty of the weight of an exoskeleton is more likely to offset the effects of the assistance.  Due to limited studies on assisted running, we do not yet know which joint is best in as- sisting and which moment profile is optimal. A common thought in the field of exoskele- ton research over the previous decade is that assistance profiles should mimic the biolog- ical moments. However, in recent studies on walking, it has been demonstrated that higher reductions in metabolic cost can be achieved by exploring the metabolic landscape of the wearer by conducting parameter sweeps to identify the optimal actuation profiles (1, 2, 7, 8).

Collins∗  Abstract—Ankle inversion-eversion compliance is an important feature of conventional prosthetic feet, and control of inversion, or roll, in active prostheses could improve balance for people with amputation. We designed a tethered ankle-foot prosthesis with two independently-actuated toes that are coordinated to provide plantarﬂexion and inversion-eversion torques. A Bowden cable tether provides series elasticity. The prosthesis is simple and lightweight, with a mass of 0.72 kg. Strain gauges on the toes measure torque with less than 1% RMS error. Benchtop tests demonstrated a rise time of less than 33 ms, peak torques of 250 N·m in plantarﬂexion and ±30 N·m in inversion-eversion, and peak power above 3 kW. The phase-limited closed-loop torque bandwidth is 20 Hz with a chirp from 10 to 90 N·m in plantarﬂexion, and 24 Hz with a chirp from −20 to 20 N·m in inversion. The system has low sensitivity to toe position disturbances at frequencies of up to 18 Hz. Walking trials with an amputee subject demonstrated RMS torque tracking errors of less than 5.1 N·m in plantarﬂexion and less than 1.5 N·m in inversion-eversion. These properties make the platform suitable for testing inversion-related prosthesis features and controllers in experiments with humans.

An assist method was developed that coordinates the walk ratio of users while increasing their propulsive force. This assist method was implemented through a hardware system that consists of low-profile actuators and compact electrical components. The device is light and adaptable to users of various shape and size. A long-term experiment showed that elderly subjects using the walking assist device were eventually able to walk with a wider stride, at a higher speed, and with a lower heart rate, without help from the device. Their balance of muscular usage also changed accordingly. Energy consumption increased according to the increase in the subjects’ speed. This result suggests the possibility of using the walking assist device as a tool for increasing elderly peoples’ physical activity, while reducing the level of stress this would normally produce.  1. Introduction  According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the number of Japanese citizens aged 65 or over reached 28.19 million (12.03 million men and 16.16 million women) in 2008. This represents 22.1% of the total population, indicating that Japan has become a full-fledged elderly society(1). Many of Japan’s elderly citizens are living their lives without concern for their age, and are actively involving themselves in social activities in their particular communities. The maintenance or enhancement of the individual’s physical functions can be considered an important factor in the ability to live this type of active life.  The physical functions of elderly individuals decline as their physical strength declines with advancing age. This not only reduces their level of activity, but produces a vicious circle in which insecurity regarding going out and other issues lead to greater declines in physical function. Insufficient muscular strength can be considered to be the main factor in the decline of physical function among the elderly. Muscle training has been recommended for the elderly in the United States since the 1990s, and","id":"79289a97-2974-48ed-992d-2ba764bbc10f"}

Herr, IEEE Member  Abstract— Although great advances have been made in the design and control of lower extremity prostheses, walking on different terrains, such as ramps or stairs, and transitioning between these terrains remains a major challenge for the field. In order to generalize biomimetic behaviour of active lower- limb prostheses top-down volitional control is required but has until recently been deemed unfeasible due to the difficulties involved in acquiring an adequate electromyographic (EMG) signal. In this study, we hypothesize that a transtibial amputee can extend the functionality of a hybrid controller, designed for level ground walking, to stair ascent and descent by volitionally modulating powered plantar-flexion of the prosthesis. We here present data illustrating that the participant is able to reproduce ankle push-off behaviour of the intrinsic controller during stair ascent as well as prevent inadvertent push-off during stair descent. Our findings suggest that EMG signal from the residual limb muscles can be used to transition between level-ground walking and stair ascent\/descent within a single step and significantly improve prosthesis performance during stair-ambulation.  We here present preliminary clinical data on a hybrid, a volitional EMG neuromuscular reflex-model framework (positive force feedback [12, 13]). Unlike previous studies, user intention is not used to derive state transitions but to proportionally control push-off by a powered ankle-foot prosthesis, as recently illustrated for level ground walking [14]. We hypothesized that volitional control enables the amputee to generalize the behavior of the level ground walking state machine to stair ascent and descent, even though walking states differ between these three types of gait [15]. In particular we hypothesized that a) the amputee would be able to produce push-off torques and toe-off ankle angles comparable to that generated using the intrinsic controller and the biological limb during stair ascent and b) to prevent inadvertent ankle push-off during stair descent.  controller  implemented within  II.

INTRODUCTION Observe gait is clinically important to allow physical therapists (PT) and clinicians to assess motor deficits in patients. However, the inconsistent results in the skill of visual assessment lead to a question about whether clinicians are accurate and reliable on gait judgment[1, 2]. Also, little is known about which gait features would base accurate judgments. The purpose of this study is to investigate (1) the differences in observational gait analysis skill between those with different level of clinical experience and (2) the kinematics features informative for perceiving amputee gait. We introduced a new method that combines biological motion and principal component analysis (PCA) to gradually mesh amputee and typical walking patterns for raters to rank. The synthesized patterns preserved the kinematics features that allow physical therapists (PT), PT students (PTS), and novice raters to discriminate different levels of gait impairment. This method can be used to train and evaluate observational gait analysis of PTs, physicians, and prosthetists. In addition, the identified gait features that PTs attended to might inform the future design of automated, clinically relevant gait evaluation and automatic prosthesis tuning algorithm in the future.

Molinaro, Student Member, IEEE, Inseung Kang, Student Member, IEEE, Jonathan Camargo, Student Member, IEEE, Aaron J. Young   AbstractMachine learning (ML) algorithms present an opportunity to estimate joint kinetics using a limited set of mechanical sensors. These estimates could be used as a continuous reference signal for exoskeleton control, able to modulate exoskeleton assistance in real-world environments. In this study, sagittal plane biological hip torque during level ground, incline and decline walking was calculated using inverse dynamics of human subject data. Subsequently, this torque was estimated using neural network (NN) and XGBoost ML models. Model inputs consisted solely of mechanical sensor data onboard a robotic hip exoskeleton. These results were compared to a baseline method of estimating hip torque as the mean torque profile during ambulation. On average across conditions, the NN and XGBoost models estimated biological hip torque with an RMSE of 0.116±0.015 and 0.108±0.011 Nm\/kg, respectively, which was significantly less than the baseline estimation that had an RMSE of 0.300±0.145 Nm\/kg (p<0.05). Fitting the baseline method to ambulation mode specific data significantly reduced overall RMSE by 59.3%; however, the ML models were still significantly better than the baseline method (p<0.05). These results show that machine learning algorithms can estimate biological hip torque using only mechanical sensors onboard a hip exoskeleton better than simply using an average torque profile. This suggests that these estimation models could be suitable for modulating exoskeleton assistance. Additionally, no evidence suggested the need to train separate ML models for each ambulation mode as estimation RMSE was not significantly different across unified and separated ML models.  assistance modulation. Given these limitations, it remains unclear how well this approach would modulate bio-inspired assistance during multimodal, overground walking.","id":"17d1d7ae-945d-472e-afac-202ee282e50e"}

Martin1, Ricardo Reyes1, and Steven H. Collins1  1Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University  Exoskeletons that assist the hip, knee, and ankle joints have be- gun to improve human mobility, particularly by reducing the metabolic cost of walking. However, direct comparisons of op- timal assistance of these joints, or their combinations, have not yet been possible. Assisting multiple joints may be more bene- ﬁcial than the sum of individual effects, because muscles often span multiple joints, or less effective, because single-joint as- sistance can indirectly aid other joints. In this study, we used a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton emulator paired with human-in-the- loop optimization to ﬁnd single-joint, two-joint, and whole-leg assistance that maximally reduced the metabolic cost of walk- ing for three participants. Hip-only and ankle-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 26% and 30% relative to walking in the device unassisted, conﬁrming that both joints are good targets for assistance. Knee-only assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 13%, demonstrating that ef- fective knee assistance is possible. Two-joint assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by between 34% and 42%, with the largest improvements coming from hip-ankle assistance. As- sisting all three joints reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 50%, showing that at least half of the metabolic energy ex- pended during walking can be saved through exoskeleton as- sistance. Changes in kinematics and muscle activity indicate that single-joint assistance indirectly assisted muscles at other joints, such that the improvement from whole-leg assistance was smaller than the sum of its single-joint parts.

Lawson, Student Member, IEEE, Brian Ruhe, Amanda Shultz, Student Member, IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb∗, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper presents the design and validation of a control system for a pair of powered knee and ankle prostheses to be used as a prosthetic intervention for bilateral transfemoral amputees. The control system leverages communication between the prostheses for enhanced awareness and stability, along with power generation at the knee and ankle joints to better restore biomechanical functionality in level ground walking. The control methodology employed is a combination of an impedance-based framework for weight-bearing portions of gait and a trajectory- based approach for the nonweight-bearing portions. The control system was implemented on a pair of self-contained powered knee and ankle prostheses, and the ability of the prostheses and control approach to provide walking functionality was assessed in a set of experimental trials with a bilateral transfemoral amputee subject. Speciﬁcally, experimental data from these trials indicate that the powered prostheses and bilateral control architecture provide gait kinematics that reproduce healthy gait kinematics to a greater extent than the subject’s daily-use passive prostheses.  Index Terms—Powered prosthesis, robotics, transfemoral.  I. INTRODUCTION  I T is difﬁcult to estimate the number of bilateral lower limb  amputees living in the United States. In the largest amputee demographicstudyknowntotheauthors,personssufferingmul- tiple amputations were not distinguished, although the total number of amputees was shown to be both large (with over 600 000 being either above the knee, below the knee, or the foot) and rapidly growing (projected to double over the next 50 years) [1]. The absence of an explicit report of the number of bilateral transfemoral amputees in the preceding study suggests that the population may be relatively small compared to the total number of persons living with a lower limb amputation.","id":"caba292d-3f12-4d0a-929b-fffff5015927"}

First published Feb- ruary 24, 2016; doi:10.1152\/jn.00941.2015.—Movements can be learned implicitly in response to new environmental demands or explicitly through instruction and strategy. The former is often studied in an environment that perturbs movement so that people learn to correct the errors and store a new motor pattern. Here, we demonstrate in human walking that implicit learning of foot placement occurs even when an explicit strategy is used to block changes in foot placement during the learning process. We studied people learning a new walking pattern on a split-belt treadmill with and without an explicit strategy through instruction on where to step. When there is no instruction, subjects implicitly learn to place one foot in front of the other to minimize step-length asymmetry during split-belt walking, and the learned pattern is maintained when the belts are returned to the same speed, i.e., postlearning. When instruction is provided, we block expression of the new foot-placement pattern that would otherwise naturally develop from adaptation. Despite this appearance of no learning in foot placement, subjects show similar postlearning effects as those who were not given any instruction. Thus locomotor adap- tation is not dependent on a change in action during learning but instead can be driven entirely by an unexpressed internal recalibration of the desired movement.  adaptation; feedback; gait; motor learning; walking","id":"c523e5e1-9674-4b0e-bf47-7cb6ded595c2"}

The results showed that we could even predict movement start 100 ms prior to the actual, thus allowing any physical systems to start up.

In this article, several deep variants of BLS are reviewed, and a new adaptive incremen- tal structure, Stacked BLS, is proposed. The proposed model is a novel incremental stacking of BLS. This invariant inherits the efﬁciency and effectiveness of BLS that the structure and weights of lower layers of BLS are ﬁxed when the new blocks are added. The incremental stacking algorithm computes not only the con- nection weights between the newly stacking blocks but also the connection weights of the enhancement nodes within the BLS block. The Stacked BLS is considered as the increment of “layers” and “neurons” dynamically during the training for multilayer neural networks. The proposed architecture along with the training algorithms that utilizes the residual characteristic is very versatile in comparison with traditional ﬁxed architecture. Finally, experimental results on UCI datasets, MNIST dataset, NORB dataset, CIFAR-10 dataset, SVHN dataset, and CIFAR- 100 dataset indicate that the proposed method outperforms the selected state-of-the-art methods on both accuracy and training speed, such as deep residual networks.

Agrawal1,3  Accepted: 5 December 2017  Published: xx xx xxxx  Gait and balance disorders are major problems that contribute to falls among subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Strengthening the compensatory responses through the use of balance perturbations may improve balance in PD. To date, it is unclear how PD affects the ability to react and adapt to perturbations delivered while walking. This study aims to investigate how PD affects the ability to walk, respond to balance perturbations, and produce acute short-term effects to improve compensatory reactions and gait stability. A cable-driven robot was used to train nine patients with PD and nine age-matched controls with multidirectional waist-pull perturbations while walking on a treadmill. Margin of stability and base of support were evaluated while walking without cables and reacting to the perturbations. PD was associated with a reduced stability in the forward direction and the inability to produce proactive anticipatory adjustments. Both groups were able to improve the response to the disturbances and produce short-term aftereffects of increased gait stability once the cables were removed. A single session of perturbation-based balance training produced acute effects that ameliorated gait instability in PD. This result is encouraging for designing new therapeutic interventions that remediate falls risk.  Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results primarily from a progressive loss of substan- tia nigra neurons within the basal ganglia that produce dopamine, an important neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of movement1. Individuals with PD commonly experience gait and balance disorders which contribute to falls, mobility loss, reduced independence and quality of life2–4. Balance impairment is difficult to treat with dopaminergic medication, which suggests a contribution by non-dopaminergic lesions5. In some cases, exercise and motor training can improve the performance of balance-related activities3. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that these improvements translate into prevention of falls3. This may be due to the fact that current training meth- ods fail to target the specific neuromuscular skills required for fall prevention6.","id":"a4c37db9-d36a-4fa5-8d39-1ff833e33dab"}

Despite the challenge, some exoskeletons have managed to lessen the metabolic expenditure of walking, either by adding or storing and returning energy. We show that the use of an exoskeleton that strategically removes kinetic energy during the swing period of the gait cycle reduces the metabolic cost of walking by 2.5 ± 0.8% for healthy male users while converting the removed energy into 0.25 ± 0.02 watts of electrical power.

Over-ground leg ex- oskeletons commonly use traditional rigid link architectures or support the weight of a user by strapping the user in a harness. This results in bulky and large architectures which are cumbersome and restrictive. C-ALEX is a leg exoskeleton without a rigid link structure which has been used in gait training on a treadmill. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using the C-ALEX exoskeleton over-ground. We converted C-ALEX into a carted system for over-ground use. We tested the architecture on eight healthy subjects to compare the controller’s RMS joint torque errors, the effects on step height, joint angles and the deviation of ankle trajectories from target trajectories. The results show that C-ALEX’s controller and tension planner have comparable RMS torque errors with no signiﬁcant difference between the two use cases. C-ALEX is able to increase the step height, affect knee ﬂexion in both walking conditions with no signiﬁcant difference.

The primary novel aspect of the controller is that it employs a virtual flow field to influence movement during swing, rather than a more typical potential-energy-based field. The controller was tested on a single stroke subject. The stroke subject’s leg kinematics demonstrate that the controller is capable of appropriately influencing leg kinematics during overground walking. I. INTRODUCTION ach year, about 665,000 people survive a stroke in the United States. Studies indicate that six months after the stroke, about 50% of these individuals had some form of lower extremity hemiparesis, and 30% were unable to walk without assistance [1], [2]. The resulting loss of mobility has detrimental effects on people’s physical and mental health and quality of life. Conventional post-stroke gait therapy includes overground gait training, in which one or more physical therapists (PTs) manually guides a patient’s movement while walking [3]. Lower limb exoskeletons may offer an assistive tool to PTs to aid in overground gait therapy. In this scenario, the exoskeleton can guide the patient’s legs through a desired motion, while a single PT can provide balance assistance (e.g., with a gait belt). In order to provide appropriate functionality in this regard, an exoskeleton should ideally offer movement guidance and assistance without interfering with a patient’s ability to correct for walking balance. Since two important factors in balance correction during walking are selection of step time and step length, an exoskeleton controller for these purposes should ideally allow patient-controlled variability in step length and step time [4], [5]. Some prior work has described controllers that influence walking motion, while allowing a patient to control step length or step time [6]–[10]. These controllers can loosely be grouped into two categories: 1) oscillator-based approaches [6], [7] and 2) potential-energy-based path approaches [8]–[10]. Both have been shown to be effective for overground exoskeleton-assisted walking. However, both have limitations. Specifically, since oscillator-based approaches do not employ a reference path, they are limited in their ability to influence inter-joint coordination during walking. Path-based approaches can influence inter-joint coordination, and are constructed of potential-energy-based fields","id":"800871d9-2552-4b96-9844-9da5491e2579"}

L. Philip Chen , Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—The broad learning system (BLS) paradigm has recently emerged as a computationally efﬁcient approach to supervised learning. Its efﬁciency arises from a learning mecha- nism based on the method of least-squares. However, the need for storing and inverting large matrices can put the efﬁciency of such mechanism at risk in big-data scenarios. In this work, we propose a new implementation of BLS in which the need for storing and inverting large matrices is avoided. The distinguishing features of the designed learning mechanism are as follows: 1) the training process can balance between efﬁcient usage of memory and required iterations (hybrid recursive learning) and 2) retraining is avoided when the network is expanded (incremental learning). It is shown that, while the proposed framework is equivalent to the standard BLS in terms of trained network weights,much larger networks than the standard BLS can be smoothly trained by the proposed solution, projecting BLS toward the big-data frontier.

A. Background on Broad Learning System  The broad learning system (BLS) paradigm has recently emerged as a supervised learning method in which the hypoth- esis is improved by expanding the network in width rather than depth. Reasons behind the study of BLS come from some recognized issues of deep structures, such as overcoming the need for gradient-descent training that might make learning slow [19]–[21], preventing complete retraining when new hypotheses must be formulated [22]–[24], and avoiding huge processing power, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) that are typically needed in deep structures [25].

Geberth, and Hartmut Geyer  Abstract—Variable swing-leg placement is crucial for robust and stable locomotion. While appropriate leg placement is generated in humanoid robotics by tracking pre-planned swing motions, this approach is not suitable for controlling powered limbs like prostheses, which form only part of the human-robot locomotor system. In recent work, we proposed swing controls for a double pendulum leg model that predicts variable and robust leg placement in the presence of large gait disturbances. Here we evaluate the performance of these novel controls on robotic leg testbeds. In hardware experiments we ﬁnd that the control achieves robust foot placement of anthropomorphic robotic limbs within a range of landing leg angles observed in human gait. We further observe that a version of this control that conforms with the constraints of neuromuscular dynamics generates a more human-like leg behavior at the cost of placement precision. The results suggest that the proposed controls transfer well to robotic limb systems; in particular, they may enable improved balance recovery in amputee locomotion with powered leg prostheses.  Index Terms—Legged Locomotion, Swing-Leg, Humanoid,  Prosthesis, Neuromuscular Control.  I. INTRODUCTION  LEGGED animals and robots use foot placement to bal-  ance dynamically [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. Successful foot placement ﬁrst requires the identiﬁcation of proper placement targets that stabilize locomotion, which can be obtained from simple point mass gait models in walking [6] [7] and run- ning [8] [9]. Once identiﬁed, the second task is the control of the swing-leg into these targets, which is achieved in robotic applications in several ways. Humanoid systems use centralized control strategies that pre-plan and execute full- body trajectories using inverse dynamics and kinematics [10] [11]. These strategies have enabled robots to walk [12], climb stairs [13], and react to push disturbances [14] [15]. However, they are not suited for the control of robotic limbs such as prostheses, where the robot forms only part of the locomoting system.","id":"b706dbf9-f766-43a9-9a2a-a426a0ecac6a"}

Farris: ryan.farris@vanderbilt.edu; Michael Goldfarb: michael.goldfarb@vanderbilt.edu  Abstract  This paper describes a powered lower-limb orthosis that is intended to provide gait assistance to spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals by providing assistive torques at both hip and knee joints, along with a user interface and control structure that enables control of the powered orthosis via upper-body influence. The orthosis and control structure was experimentally implemented on a paraplegic subject (T10 complete) in order to provide a preliminary characterization of its capability to provide basic walking. Data and video is presented from these initial trials, which indicates that the orthosis and controller are able to effectively provide walking within parallel bars at an average speed of 0.8 km\/hr.  Index Terms  lower limb exoskeleton; assistive technology; powered orthosis; SCI; paraplegia  I. Introduction  THERE are currently about 262,000 spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals in the United States, with roughly 12,000 new injuries sustained each year at an average age of injury of 40.2 years [1]. Of these, at least 44% (at least 5300 cases per year) result in paraplegia. One of the most significant impairments resulting from paraplegia is the loss of mobility, particularly given the relatively young (average) age at which such injuries occur. Surveys of persons with paraplegia indicate that mobility concerns are among the most prevalent [2], and that chief among mobility desires is the ability to walk and stand [3]. In addition to impaired mobility, the inability to stand and walk entails severe physiological effects, including muscular atrophy, loss of bone mineral content, frequent skin breakdown problems, increased incidence of urinary tract infection, muscle spasticity, impaired lymphatic and vascular circulation, impaired digestive operation, and reduced respiratory and cardiovascular capacities [4].","id":"b7f6232d-0385-4cd8-bc80-d75ec62bd8fa"}

In this article, a torque prediction method based on collaborative neuromusculoskeletal modeling and adaptive learning, is proposed to overcome the limitation of existing is designed in methods. First, an sEMG-torque model comprehensive consideration of the previous research results, the requirement for subject-speciﬁc adjustment and the coupling between the muscle or muscle-tendon length and the adjacent joint angles, where the latter two factors have rarely been considered in the literature. Then, by combining the advantages of the stochastic particle swarm optimization and conjugate gradient algorithms, a collaborative optimization method is designed to calibrate simultaneously the undetermined parameters. Moreover, an adaptive learning method based on Gaussian process regression is proposed to learn and predict the estimation errors in real time, by which it is supposed that the torque prediction accuracy can be improved efﬁciently. Finally, experiments were carried out to validate the performance of the proposed method.  Manuscript received September 7, 2019; revised January 17, 2020 and March 16, 2020; accepted April 14, 2020.

Rouse2,3  When fitting prosthetic feet, prosthetists fuse information from their visual assessment of patient gait with the patient’s communicated perceptions and preferences. In this study, we sought to simultaneously and independently assess patient and prosthetist preference for prosthetic foot stiffness using a custom variable-stiffness prosthesis. In the first part of the experiment, seven subjects with below-knee amputation walked on the variable-stiffness prosthetic foot set to a randomized stiffness, while several prosthetist subjects simultaneously observed their gait. After each trial, the amputee subjects and prosthetist subjects indicated the change to stiffness that they would prefer (increase or decrease). this paradigm allowed us to simultaneously measure amputee subject and prosthetist subject preferences, and provided a reliability index indicating the consistency of their preferences. In the second part of the experiment, amputee subjects were instructed to communicate verbally with one prosthetist subject to arrive at a mutually preferred stiffness. On average, prosthetist subjects preferred a 26% higher stiffness than amputee subjects (p < 0.001), though this depended on the amputee subject (p < 0.001). Prosthetist subjects were also considerably less consistent than amputee subjects in their preferences (CV of 5.6% for amputee subjects, CV of 23% for prosthetist subjects; p = 0.014). Mutual preference seemed to be dictated by the specific patient- prosthetist dynamic, and no clear trends emerged.","id":"93650a42-4ece-4c74-874d-74ab4f36b8d3"}

Gutierrez-Farewik  Abstract—Accurately predicting joint torque using wear- able sensors is crucial for designing assist-as-needed exoskeleton controllers to assist muscle-generated torque and ensure successful task performance. In this paper, we estimated ankle dorsiflexion\/plantarflexion, knee flex- ion\/extension, hip flexion\/extension, and hip abduc- tion\/adduction torques from electromyography (EMG) and kinematics during daily activities using neuromuscu- loskeletal (NMS) models and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The joint torque ground truth for model calibrating and training was obtained through inverse dynamics of captured motion data. A cluster approach that grouped movements based on characteristic simi- larity was implemented, and its ability to improve the estimation accuracy of both NMS and LSTM models was evaluated. We compared torque estimation accuracy of NMS and LSTM models in three cases: Pooled, Individual, and Clustered models. Pooled models used data from all 10 movements to calibrate or train one model, Individual models used data from each individual movement, and Clustered models used data from each cluster. Individual, Clustered and Pooled LSTM models all had relatively high joint torque estimation accuracy. Individual and Clustered NMS models had similarly good estimation performance whereas the Pooled model may be too generic to satisfy all movement patterns. While the cluster approach improved the estimation accuracy in NMS models in some move- ments, it made relatively little difference in the LSTM neural networks, which already had high estimation accuracy. Our study provides practical implications for designing assist- as-needed exoskeleton controllers by offering guidelines for selecting the appropriate model for different scenarios, and has potential to enhance the functionality of wearable exoskeletons and improve rehabilitation and assistance for individuals with motor disorders.

Detection of IEDs is signiﬁ- cant for the diagnosis of epilepsy and the prediction of seizures. In this letter, we proposed a graph convolutional network and bi-directional LSTM co-embedded broad learning system to detect IEDS.

In addition, bi-directional LSTM is also adopted for extracting the temporal feature from signals.

Moreover, Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) have been a biomarker for neurologists to diagnose epilepsy and predict seizures, which are the main target of clinical EEG interpretation [3]. It usually appears as sharp waves, spikes, or spike-wave-complexes in EEG [4]. Currently, the detection of IEDs is mainly done manually by neurologists. However, visual evaluation has various limitations, such as time-consuming reviews, interobserver variability, requirement of highly experienced and skilled neurologists [5], [6]. Hence, it is a necessary to develop an automated IEDs detection system. Some attempts have already been made to detect IEDs from scalp EEG signals, including morphology-based [7], [8], signal correlation-based [9], [10], feature engineering-based [11], and time-frequency decomposition-based [12], or the ensemble of multiple methods [13]. Due to the huge morphological differ- ence of spikes across patients and the subjectivity of neurolo- gists’ criteria, none of these methods can achieve universally accepted results [14], [15].  I.

INTRODUCTION  T HERE are between 40 000 and 100 000 individuals in the  U.S. with major upper extremity limb loss, roughly 40% of whom are transhumeral (above elbow) amputees [1], [2]. Transhumeral prostheses can aid individuals with transhumeral amputation to more capably perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Two major types of functional upper extremity pros- theses exist—the body-powered type and the myoelectric type. In the case of a transhumeral prosthesis, both types typically include an elbow joint and a terminal device (often either a split hook or a hand). The body-powered prosthesis type in- corporates Bowden cables, typically a pair, both attached to a shoulder harness worn by the user, such that the appropriate movement of the shoulder (e.g., shoulder ﬂexion and scapular abduction) will generate excursion of the respective cable. Al- though different variations exist, a common embodiment is the dual-control system, in which one cable (e.g., coupled to shoul- der ﬂexion) is used to provide movement of both the elbow and terminal device (i.e., cable excursion will simultaneously actu- ate both elbow ﬂexion and terminal device opening), while the other cable (e.g., coupled to scapular abduction) is used to lock or unlock the elbow [3].

Accessing joint moments outside clinical and laboratory settings requires harnessing non-invasive wearable sensor data for indirect estimation. Previous approaches have been primarily validated dur- ing cyclic tasks, such as walking, but these methods are likely limited when translating to non-cyclic tasks where the mapping from kinematics to moments is not unique. Methods: We trained deep learning models to estimate hip and knee joint moments from kinematic sensors, elec- tromyography (EMG), and simulated pressure insoles from a dataset including 10 cyclic and 18 non-cyclic activities. We assessed estimation error on combinations of sensor modalities during both activity types. Results: Compared to the kinematics-only baseline, adding EMG reduced RMSE by 16.9% at the hip and 30.4% at the knee (p < 0.05) and adding insoles reduced RMSE by 21.7% at the hip and 33.9% at the knee (p < 0.05). Adding both modalities re- duced RMSE by 32.5% at the hip and 41.2% at the knee (p < 0.05) which was signiﬁcantly higher than either modal- ity individually (p < 0.05).

Lee, Luke M. Mooney, StudentMember,IEEE, and Elliott J. Rouse, Member,IEEE  Abstract—The majority of commercially available pas- sive prosthetic feet are not capable of providing joint mechanics that match that of the intact human ankle. Due to their cantilever design, their stiffness characteristics contrast with what has been observed in the biological ankle, namely, an increase in stiffness during the stance phase of walking. In this paper, we introduce the design and control of a pneumatic foot-ankle prosthesis that attempts to provide biomimetic mechanics. The prosthesis is com- prised of a pneumatic cylinder in series with a ﬁberglass leaf spring, and a solenoid valve to control the ﬂow of air between the two sides of the cylinder. The solenoid valve acts as a mechanical clutch, enabling resetting of the ankle’s equilibrium position. By adjusting the pressure inside the cylinder, the prosthesis can be customized to provide a range of ankle mechanics. A mechanical testing machine is used to compare the torque-angle curve of the pneumatic prosthesis with a low-proﬁle passive prosthetic foot. Finally, data are presented of one transtibial amputee walking with the prosthesis at 1.2 m\/s. The testing shows that the pneumatic prosthesis is capable of providing an appropriate range of motion as well a maximum torque of 94 Nm, while returning approximately 11.5 J of energy.","id":"df17feb7-3b0c-4352-8630-1836b12bdd94"}

Abstract: Cycling stands as one of the most widely embraced leisure activities and serves purposes such as exercise, rehabilitation, and commuting. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of assisting three unimpaired participants (age: 34.0 ± 7.9 years, height: 1.86 ± 0.02 m, weight: 75.7 ± 12.7 kg) using the GuroX hip exoskeleton, originally designed for walking assistance, during cycling against a resistance of 1W\/kg. The performance evaluation employed a sweep protocol that manipulated the timing of the exoskeleton’s peak extension and flexion torque in addition to human-in-the-loop optimization to enhance these timings based on metabolic cost. Our findings indicate that with a peak assistance torque of approximately 10.3Nm for extension and flexion, the GuroX substantially reduced the net metabolic cost of cycling by 31.4 ± 8.1% and 26.4 ± 14.1% compared to transparent and without exoskeleton conditions, respectively. This demonstrates the significant potential of a hip exoskeleton developed for walking assistance to profoundly benefit cycling. Additionally, customizing the assistance strategy proves beneficial in maximizing assistance. While we attribute the average motor power to be a major contributor to the reduced cycling effort, participant feedback suggests that user comfort and synchronization between the user and exoskeleton may have played integral roles. Further research should validate our initial findings by employing a larger participant pool in real-world conditions. Incorporating a more diverse set of parameters for the human-in-the- loop optimization could enhance individualized assistance strategies.

In this article, a torque prediction method based on collaborative neuromusculoskeletal modeling and adaptive learning, is proposed to overcome the limitation of existing is designed in methods. First, an sEMG-torque model comprehensive consideration of the previous research results, the requirement for subject-speciﬁc adjustment and the coupling between the muscle or muscle-tendon length and the adjacent joint angles, where the latter two factors have rarely been considered in the literature. Then, by combining the advantages of the stochastic particle swarm optimization and conjugate gradient algorithms, a collaborative optimization method is designed to calibrate simultaneously the undetermined parameters. Moreover, an adaptive learning method based on Gaussian process regression is proposed to learn and predict the estimation errors in real time, by which it is supposed that the torque prediction accuracy can be improved efﬁciently.

IEEE\/ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS  Adaptive Admittance Control Strategy for a Robotic Knee Exoskeleton With a Nonlinear Variable Stiffness Actuator  Bing Chen , Lei Zhou, Bin Zi  , Eric Li  , and Dan Zhang , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—This article presents the design and control of a robotic knee exoskeleton for gait rehabilitation of patients with knee joint impairments. First, the hardware design of the exoskeleton is presented, including the mechanical structure, actuator design and conﬁguration, and electronic system. Based on the nonlinear characteristics of human muscles, a nonlinear variable stiffness actuator (NLVSA) is designed for the actuation system of the exoskeleton. Next, the modeling of the NLVSA is described. In addition, an adaptive admittance control strategy comprising a spar- row search optimization algorithm-based long short-term memory neural network model and an adaptive admittance control algorithm based on the radial basis function neural network (RBFAAC) is proposed for the exoskeleton. Finally, a pilot study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the robotic knee exoskeleton. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the designed NLVSA, and the exoskeleton has the potential for human knee rehabilitation by providing effective assistance with the proposed control strategy. With the proposed RBFAAC algorithm, the average root mean square error between the reference and actual knee joint angles is 1.24° at different walking speeds.

INTRODUCTION  N OWADAYS, the motor function damage of a human knee  joint caused by a stroke, spinal cord injury, osteoarthritis, and other related diseases often occurs [1], [2], which makes it difﬁcult for individuals with muscle weakness or paralysis to perform activities of daily living [3]. Medical investigation demonstrates that lower limb motor function can be gradually improved by timely and repetitive rehabilitation training in indi- viduals with gait disorders [1], [4]. Therefore, medical devices such as robotic knee exoskeletons that can enable individuals with knee joint impairments to regain the ability to walk with a normal gait and, hence, to enhance their independence and well-being are desirable [5].","id":"fb3cc4a3-4d39-4a79-86cb-f9e51b67700c"}

The authors have previously proposed a multi-joint control method called a ﬂow controller, which provides several desirable characteristics for such assistance. In this paper, the authors adapt the fundamentally multi-joint ﬂow control approach to a system with a single actuated joint, but with multiple movement degrees of freedom. The single degree of actuation ﬂow control method was implemented on a representative system, speciﬁcally a knee exoskeleton that coordinates assistance with ipsilateral thigh move- ment during walking. The ability of the controller and knee exoskeleton to appropriately inﬂuence knee movement was evaluated in level walking experiments on three subjects with unilateral lower-limb impairment. Results show the device and controller provide improvements in knee move- ment in all subjects. Subjective feedback from the subjects indicates a high level of comfort with the controller.

Common causes of movement impairment include stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and cerebral palsy. Individuals who have movement impairment, but are still capable of ambulation, are herein referred to as poorly-ambulatory individuals. Poorly-ambulatory individuals’ leg movements are typically characterized by leg muscle weak- ness and potentially also by spastic muscle tone.

Characterizing Optimal Performance of a Passive Elastic Ankle Exoskeleton during Human Locomotion. (Under the direction of Gregory S. Sawicki).  Perhaps because humans are already so well-tuned for locomotion, no  autonomous, wearable device intended to assist walking or running has succeeded  in reducing metabolic energy consumption for healthy individuals during typical  walking conditions. The ankle provides the majority of positive mechanical work  during walking and much of this work is delivered via elastic recoil from the Achilles’  tendon, which may serve as an energy savings mechanism. My goal for Chapter 1  was to develop a portable ankle exoskeleton taking inspiration from the passive  elastic mechanisms at play in the human triceps surae-Achilles’ tendon complex  during walking.  The exoskeleton was designed to be as transparent to the user as possible  having minimal interference with gait kinematics and lightweight enough to minimize  the metabolic penalty of adding mass to the user. I designed the exoskeleton to  provide plantarflexion torque during stance, and not interfere with toe clearance  during swing. To do this I developed a lightweight custom composite frame and two  clutches that can engage and disengage a parallel spring based only on ankle  kinematic state. The primary system is purely passive containing no motors,  electronics or external power supply. A secondary clutch has an additional low  power, servomotor to control the timing of engagement of the clutch, which still  passively provides assistance but is more versatile and can handle dynamically  changing gait (e.g. increases in speed, asymmetry due to impairment).  To test the validity of our exoskeleton design I performed a variety of studies  of individuals walking in many conditions with and without the exoskeleton, on a split  belt instrumented treadmill. Kinetic, kinematic, electromyography, and oxygen  consumption and carbon dioxide expiration were recorded during all trials. Initial  testing of the exoskeleton in Chapter 1 suggests the utility of the clutch, to act in  series with the parallel spring. My results indicate the clutched exoskeleton design  addresses all three of our design criteria: (1) it does not hinder natural gait  kinematics, (2) it is lightweight enough so that added mass has minimal effect on net  metabolic energy consumption, and (3) it can produce significant plantarflexor torque  assistance during stance, but does not resist toe clearance during swing.","id":"94136b50-4dab-408b-ac63-60d566040788"}

Walsh  1  2  Published online: xx xx xxxx  Check for updates  Exoskeletons can augment the performance of unimpaired users and restore movement in individuals with gait impairments. Knowledge of how users interact with wearable devices and of the physiology of locomotion have informed the design of rigid and soft exoskeletons that can specifically target a single joint or a single activity. In this Review, we highlight the main advances of the past two decades in exoskeleton technology and in the development of lower-extremity exoskeletons for locomotor assistance, discuss research needs for such wearable robots and the clinical requirements for exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation, and outline the main clinical challenges and opportunities for exoskeleton technology.  Exoskeletons aiding locomotion entered the popular imagination over a century ago, followed by a series of early patents and prototypes1–5. Among other advances in the late twentieth and early twenty-first cen- tury, funding from the Exoskeleton for Human Performance Augmen- tation Program6 of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the United States enabled the development of wearable robotic devices for the lower extremities (in particular, the Berkeley lower-extremity exoskeleton, BLEEX7,8; the Sarcos Guardian XO9; and the MIT quasi-passive exoskeleton10–13) to augment strength and reduce effort during the carriage of load. By taking load off the wearer and providing assistive joint torques during walking, these weight-bearing lower-extremity exoskeletons sought to increase load capacity, improve efficiency and endurance, and reduce the perceived difficulty of walk- ing11, potentially benefitting military personnel, first responders and weekend warriors. Measuring the metabolic cost of exoskeleton-aided locomotion became the gold standard for quantifying wearer effort and exertion. As such, demonstrating metabolic cost reductions compared to walking without the robot became a major goal for exoskeletons designed to augment strength and performance. Despite their promise, lower-extremity exoskeletons for performance augmentation in unim- paired users initially failed to demonstrate metabolic cost reductions","id":"ff3ab2f4-24d4-44f9-81d5-d43bb0694af4"}

Since the energy supplied by the proposed EMG is discontinuous in time, a tailored energy management circuit is necessary to adapt the harvested energy to the load energy requirements. The electromechanical generator is composed by two series of NdFeB magnets positioned into each condyle and a coil, placed in the pin of the tibial insert, which collects the magnetic flux variations, generated by the knee movements. A total knee replacement (TKR) prototype has been developed and realized in order to reproduce the knee mechanics. Therefore, electrical performances have been evaluated, at the first, measuring the EMG open circuit voltage by means of a high impedance buffer amplifier, and, subsequently, connecting the EMG to the energy management circuit able to manage the produced energy and to power an implanted circuit for force measurement inside the human knee. The tests showed that the EHS is able to supply the measuring circuit guaranteeing a tension between 2.45 V and 2.15 V for 25 ms almost every 1.5 s with a walking velocity of 1 Hz. The tests successfully demonstrate the possibility to power a measurement circuit transmitting the measurement data outside the prosthesis every about one-step and half.

Ha, Student Member, IEEE, Clare Hartigan, and Michael Goldfarb, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper presents an assessment of a lower limb exoskeleton for providing legged mobility to people with para- plegia. In particular, the paper presents a single-subject case study comparing legged locomotion using the exoskeleton to locomotion using knee–ankle–foot orthoses (KAFOs) on a subject with a T10 motor and sensory complete injury. The assessment utilizes three assessment instruments to characterize legged mobility, which are the timed up-and-go test, the Ten-Meter Walk Test (10 MWT), and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT), which collectively assess the subject’s ability to stand, walk, turn, and sit. The exertion associated with each assessment instrument was assessed using the Physiological Cost Index. Results indicate that the subject was able to perform the respective assessment instruments 25%, 70%, and 80% faster with the exoskeleton relative to the KAFOs for the timed up-and-go test, the 10 MWT, and the 6 MWT, respectively. Measurements of exertion indicate that the exoskeleton requires 1.6, 5.2, and 3.2 times less exertion than the KAFOs for each respective assessment instrument. The results indicate that the en- hancement in speed and reduction in exertion are more signiﬁcant during walking than during gait transitions.  entails signiﬁcant health consequences, including loss of bone mineral content, frequent skin breakdown problems, increased incidence of urinary tract infection, muscle spasticity, impaired lymphatic and vascular circulation, impaired digestive opera- tion, and reduced respiratory and cardiovascular capacities [2]. In an effort to restore legged locomotion to individuals with paraplegia, several computer-controlled lower limb orthoses have been, and are being, developed and described in the research literature. Such orthoses include hybrid functional electrical stimulation (FES)-systems, which supplement FES of leg muscles with a computer-controlled orthosis; and fully powered orthoses (or exoskeletons), which utilize electric mo- tors as the primary form of motive assistance.

Bussmann1 and on behalf of the TREFAMS-ACE study group  Abstract  Background: Multiple sclerosis often leads to fatigue and changes in physical behavior (PB). Changes in PB are often assumed as a consequence of fatigue, but effects of interventions that aim to reduce fatigue by improving PB are not sufficient. Since the heterogeneous nature of MS related symptoms, levels of PB of fatigued patients at the start of interventions might vary substantially. Better understanding of the variability by identification of PB subtypes in fatigued patients may help to develop more effective personalized rehabilitation programs in the future. This study aimed to identify PB subtypes in fatigued patients with multiple sclerosis based on multidimensional PB outcome measures. Methods: Baseline accelerometer (Actigraph) data, demographics and clinical characteristics of the TREFAMS-ACE participants (n = 212) were used for secondary analysis. All patients were ambulatory and diagnosed with severe fatigue based on a score of ≥35 on the fatigue subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS20r). Fifteen PB measures were used derived from 7 day measurements with an accelerometer. Principal component analysis was performed to define key outcome measures for PB and two-step cluster analysis was used to identify PB types. Results: Analysis revealed five key outcome measures: percentage sedentary behavior, total time in prolonged moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, number of sedentary bouts, and two types of change scores between day parts (morning, afternoon and evening). Based on these outcomes three valid PB clusters were derived. Conclusions: Patients with severe MS-related fatigue show three distinct and homogeneous PB subtypes. These PB subtypes, based on a unique set of PB outcome measures, may offer an opportunity to design more individually-tailored interventions in rehabilitation.

We demonstrate that the pressurized actuators can generate motion and force comparable to natural human ﬁngers through bench- top testing. We apply textile-elastomer capacitive sensors to the glove to track ﬁnger ﬂexion via strain and detect contact with objects via force. Intuitive user control is achieved via a state machine controller based on signals from the integrated sensors to detect relative changes in hand-object interactions. Results from an initial evaluation with 3 participants with spinal cord injury (SCI), of varied injury levels and years since injury, wearing and controlling the glove show an average of 87% improvement in grasping force, and improvements in functional assessments for participants with recent injuries. A signiﬁcant variation in response suggests further investigation is required to understand the adaptation needed across different injury levels and durations since injury.

This paper presents the modular, multi-task optimal energy shaping (M-TOES) frame- work, which uses a convex, data-driven optimization to train an analytical control model to instantaneously estimate assistive joint torques across activities for any lower-limb exoskeleton joint configuration. The presented modular energy basis is sufficiently descriptive to fit normative human joint torques (given norma- tive feedback from signals available to a given joint configu- ration) across sit-stand transitions, stair ascent\/descent, ramp ascent\/descent, and level walking at different speeds. We evalu- ated controllers for four joint configurations (unilateral\/bilateral, hip\/knee) of the modular M-BLUE exoskeleton on eight able- bodied users navigating a multi-activity course comprising the primary activities of daily life. The two unilateral conditions significantly lowered overall muscle activation across all tasks and subjects (p < 0.001). In contrast, bilateral configurations had a minimal impact, possibly attributable to device weight and physical constraints.  Index Terms—Robotics, optimization, passivity-based control.  I.

Ha, Student Member, IEEE, Clare Hartigan, and Michael Goldfarb, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper presents an assessment of a lower limb exoskeleton for providing legged mobility to people with para- plegia. In particular, the paper presents a single-subject case study comparing legged locomotion using the exoskeleton to locomotion using knee–ankle–foot orthoses (KAFOs) on a subject with a T10 motor and sensory complete injury. The assessment utilizes three assessment instruments to characterize legged mobility, which are the timed up-and-go test, the Ten-Meter Walk Test (10 MWT), and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT), which collectively assess the subject’s ability to stand, walk, turn, and sit. The exertion associated with each assessment instrument was assessed using the Physiological Cost Index. Results indicate that the subject was able to perform the respective assessment instruments 25%, 70%, and 80% faster with the exoskeleton relative to the KAFOs for the timed up-and-go test, the 10 MWT, and the 6 MWT, respectively. Measurements of exertion indicate that the exoskeleton requires 1.6, 5.2, and 3.2 times less exertion than the KAFOs for each respective assessment instrument. The results indicate that the en- hancement in speed and reduction in exertion are more signiﬁcant during walking than during gait transitions.  entails signiﬁcant health consequences, including loss of bone mineral content, frequent skin breakdown problems, increased incidence of urinary tract infection, muscle spasticity, impaired lymphatic and vascular circulation, impaired digestive opera- tion, and reduced respiratory and cardiovascular capacities [2]. In an effort to restore legged locomotion to individuals with paraplegia, several computer-controlled lower limb orthoses have been, and are being, developed and described in the research literature. Such orthoses include hybrid functional electrical stimulation (FES)-systems, which supplement FES of leg muscles with a computer-controlled orthosis; and fully powered orthoses (or exoskeletons), which utilize electric mo- tors as the primary form of motive assistance. Recent examples of the former include those described in [3]–[7], while recent examples of the latter include those described in [8]–[16].  Index","id":"36d0ad3e-2305-46e5-bc09-ef5ea8d5c89a"}

E-mail: qiningwang@pku.edu.cn  (Accepted May 17, 2019)  SUMMARY People with severe neuromuscular trunk impairment cannot maintain or control upright posture of the upper body in sitting while reaching. Passive orthoses are clinically available to provide support and promote the use of upper extremities in this population. However, these orthoses only position the torso passively without any degree of trunk movement.  We introduce for the ﬁrst time a novel active-assistive torso brace called Wheelchair Robot for Active Postural Support (WRAPS). It consists of two rings over the hips and chest connected by a 2RPS-2UPS parallel robotic device. WRAPS can modulate the displacement of the upper ring and\/or the forces applied on the torso through the ring in four degrees-of-freedom (DOF), including rotations and translation in the sagittal and frontal planes.  In the present study, we evaluate the design of WRAPS and its functions. Moreover, we discuss the potential effectiveness of WRAPS as a therapeutic robotic tool in people with severe trunk con- trol deﬁcits. The performance of WRAPS was evaluated in seated healthy subjects. Kinematics and surface electromyography (sEMG) were collected when the participants performed selective trunk movements. First, the torso range of motion (tROM) was calculated with WRAPS in transparent mode—zero-force control mode—which was compared with free-guided tROM (no WRAPS) with motion capture system. Second, a position control mode was conﬁgured to mobilize the torso along the trajectories obtained with the transparent mode.","id":"d81169a7-26ac-4d00-81ec-0d4f54a8ee33"}

In compliance with human motion and the human body, the device not only ﬁts tightly to the lower body of a wearer, but also transmits the assisting torque to the hip\/knee joint efﬁciently and comfortably. To over- come the poor wearability and assistive performance of conventional wearable walking assistance devices, three novel mechanisms are proposed: ﬁrst, a dual reduction actuator, which makes the mechanism more compact with minimal resistance, second, compliant joints, which adapt to human motion regardless of the wearing state, wearing position, and three-dimensional human joint motions, and third, a ﬂexible foot\/ankle mechanism, which helps in rigidly transmitting the assisting force only to the forefoot. The de- veloped wearable walking assistance device based on these mechanisms was validated through experiments.  rehabilitation, the weight, size, and comfort of the device are not a big problem for the patients as long as it helps to improve their muscular strength after rehabilitation exercises. Even if the equipment is not a stand-alone device, like Lokomat developed by Hocoma [1], it can provide effective training and increase recovery potential in hospital [2].  However, if the target group is extended to the geriatric popu- lation with moderate impairments, and the place of use extends to the home rather than to the hospital, the following additional requirements should be considered. Because people commonly wish to conceal their physical weakness when in public [3], the wearable device should be slimly designed to lessen the stigma of physical illness associated with wearing an exoskele- ton.

ABSTRACT  Three individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) were tested in a laboratory setting while wearing a mobility-assisting device called a dermoskeleton. The tested device used was the B-TEMIA’s military-based version dedicated to military applications, with the necessary design adjustments for the proposed study. Participants performed standardized tasks (Time Up and Go, Stair Test, 6 Minute Walk Test) with and without the dermoskeleton, and execution times were compared. Pilot data show improvement of gait with the device in 2 of the 3 participants, in terms of stability (higher inter-step hip kinematics coherence) and endurance (longer the 6 Minute Walk Test). The distance during dermoskeleton was moderately to highly valued by participants during the laboratory tests. While the results from this pilot study suggest a potential for dermoskeletal technology in improving mobility in persons with MS, additional tests in a community setting are now required to quantify the efficacy and safety of the innovation as well as how the tested device can be used in daily activities, and more broadly improve the quality of life of its users.  a pilot study if such technology could also be useful as a means to improve endurance in persons with muscle weakness due to central nervous system lesions.","id":"9268234d-f8b3-479e-b6d0-0283a14bf1ce"}

We introduce a task-agnostic controller that assists the user on the basis of instantaneous estimates of lower-limb biological joint moments from a deep neural network. By estimating both hip and knee moments in-the-loop, our approach provided multi-joint, coordinated assistance through our autonomous, clothing-integrated exoskeleton. When deployed during 28 activities, spanning cyclic locomotion to unstructured tasks (for example, passive meandering and high-speed lateral cutting), the network accurately estimated hip and knee moments with an average R2 of 0.83 relative to ground truth. Further, our approach significantly outperformed a best-case task classifier-based method constructed from splines and impedance parameters. When tested on ten activities (including level walking, running, lifting a 25 lb (roughly 11 kg) weight and lunging), our controller significantly reduced user energetics (metabolic cost or lower-limb biological joint work depending on the task) relative to the zero torque condition, ranging from 5.3 to 19.7%, without any manual controller modifications among activities. Thus, this task-agnostic controller can enable exoskeletons to aid users across a broad spectrum of human activities, a necessity for real-world viability.","id":"a07ad7f2-3ef5-44d9-bfaf-61dceb8a6c7e"}

Shorter, Student Member, IEEE, Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE    Abstract—Human joint impedance describes the dynamic relationship between perturbation induced change in position and the resulting response torque. Understanding the natural regulation of ankle impedance during locomotion is necessary to discern how humans interact with their environments, and provide a foundation for the design of biomimetic assistive devices and their control systems. This study estimates ankle impedance during terminal stance phase of walking using a parametric model consisting of stiffness, damping, and inertia. The model accurately described ankle torque, accounting for 90% ± 7.7% of the variance. Stiffness was found to decrease linearly from 3.7 to 2.1 Nm\/rad\/kg between 75% and 85% stance. Quasi-stiffness—the slope of the ankle’s torque-angle curve— showed a similar decreasing trend but was significantly larger at the onset of terminal stance phase. The damping component of impedance was constant during terminal stance phase, and was increased relative to values previously reported during early and in mid-stance phase, preparation for toe-off. Inertia estimates were consistent with previously reported inertia values for the human ankle. This study bridges a gap in our understanding of ankle impedance during walking, and provides new insight into how ankle is regulated during regions when substantial impedance mechanical energy is added.  indicating an  increase  in damping","id":"20da7dc0-1810-4b9b-b916-667ce39d761f"}

Agrawal1,3  Accepted: 5 December 2017  Published: xx xx xxxx  Gait and balance disorders are major problems that contribute to falls among subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Strengthening the compensatory responses through the use of balance perturbations may improve balance in PD. To date, it is unclear how PD affects the ability to react and adapt to perturbations delivered while walking. This study aims to investigate how PD affects the ability to walk, respond to balance perturbations, and produce acute short-term effects to improve compensatory reactions and gait stability. A cable-driven robot was used to train nine patients with PD and nine age-matched controls with multidirectional waist-pull perturbations while walking on a treadmill. Margin of stability and base of support were evaluated while walking without cables and reacting to the perturbations. PD was associated with a reduced stability in the forward direction and the inability to produce proactive anticipatory adjustments. Both groups were able to improve the response to the disturbances and produce short-term aftereffects of increased gait stability once the cables were removed. A single session of perturbation-based balance training produced acute effects that ameliorated gait instability in PD. This result is encouraging for designing new therapeutic interventions that remediate falls risk.  Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results primarily from a progressive loss of substan- tia nigra neurons within the basal ganglia that produce dopamine, an important neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of movement1. Individuals with PD commonly experience gait and balance disorders which contribute to falls, mobility loss, reduced independence and quality of life2–4. Balance impairment is difficult to treat with dopaminergic medication, which suggests a contribution by non-dopaminergic lesions5. In some cases, exercise and motor training can improve the performance of balance-related activities3. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that these improvements translate into prevention of falls3. This may be due to the fact that current training meth- ods fail to target the specific neuromuscular skills required for fall prevention6.","id":"a4c37db9-d36a-4fa5-8d39-1ff833e33dab"}

L. Philip Chen , Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—The broad learning system (BLS) paradigm has recently emerged as a computationally efﬁcient approach to supervised learning. Its efﬁciency arises from a learning mecha- nism based on the method of least-squares. However, the need for storing and inverting large matrices can put the efﬁciency of such mechanism at risk in big-data scenarios. In this work, we propose a new implementation of BLS in which the need for storing and inverting large matrices is avoided. The distinguishing features of the designed learning mechanism are as follows: 1) the training process can balance between efﬁcient usage of memory and required iterations (hybrid recursive learning) and 2) retraining is avoided when the network is expanded (incremental learning). It is shown that, while the proposed framework is equivalent to the standard BLS in terms of trained network weights,much larger networks than the standard BLS can be smoothly trained by the proposed solution, projecting BLS toward the big-data frontier.

A. Background on Broad Learning System  The broad learning system (BLS) paradigm has recently emerged as a supervised learning method in which the hypoth- esis is improved by expanding the network in width rather than depth. Reasons behind the study of BLS come from some recognized issues of deep structures, such as overcoming the need for gradient-descent training that might make learning slow [19]–[21], preventing complete retraining when new hypotheses must be formulated [22]–[24], and avoiding huge processing power, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) that are typically needed in deep structures [25].

Biomechanical simulations could improve exoskeleton development with their ability to optimize many design and control parameters simultaneously. While promis- ing, simulations often rely on simplifying assumptions, such as ﬁxed kinematic methods. Furthermore, few simulation-based designs have been tested directly in human experiments. To evaluate the utility of simulations for exoskeleton design, we designed a controller using biomechanical simulation and then tested the controller with a hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton worn by a single experienced user. Here we show that a biomechanical simulation constrained by safe, experiment-based torque limits can ﬁnd an assistance pattern that reduces metabolic cost but with substantial differences between expected and measured outcomes. We found a simulated assistance proﬁle that was expected to reduce the metabolic cost of walking by 69.0%. When tested experimentally, it reduced the cost by 25.9% compared to walking in the device unassisted. The simulation predicted the direction of activity change in most muscles but overestimated the total magnitude of these changes. The applied torques resulted in joint kinematic and stride frequency changes that were not accounted for in the simulation. Future simulations could allow kinematic adaptations and use updated cost functions that better reﬂect how humans respond to assistance. Continued feedback between experimental testing and simulation design will build on these promising results to improve the accuracy of simulations and enhance their ability to guide future exoskeleton designs.  I. INTRODUCTION  Instead of relying on biomimicry, intuition, and hand-tuning, this technique uses measurements of the exoskeleton user to update the control of the exoskeleton to minimize a cost function. This approach has led to some of the largest reductions in metabolic cost to date [2], [3].","id":"f69a7b9c-0d87-44b1-8e8a-dfa4b37feb48"}

A pair of bilateral knee exoskeletons can potentially reduce crouch gait in this population; doing so would presumably enhance mobility for such individuals. This paper describes the implementation of a knee exoskeleton and control approach intended to improve knee kinematics in an individual with CP. The knee exoskeleton provides extension torque to combat crouch during stance and employs trajectory control to encourage knee flexion and extension during swing. The device and controller were tested on a single adult individual with CP. Though the device and controller achieved the desired local effect, the step length and walking speed of the participant were reduced. I. INTRODUCTION Cerebral Palsy (CP) has an incidence rate of approximately 2 out of every 1000 births [1], and represents the most common physical disability in children [2]. Individuals with CP often exhibit irregular gait patterns, the most common of which, crouch gait, is characterized by excessive knee flexion [3]. Crouch gait can lead to joint pain and degradation, not only at the knee but also at other joints of the lower limb [4]. As such, the mobility of individuals with CP is often limited and degrades with age [5]. Recently, exoskeletons have emerged and become a viable approach to augment lower limb motion, and it is reasonable to conjecture that a powered exoskeletal device could reduce crouch gait and facilitate improved walking movement in individuals with CP. While prior work has explored the rehabilitative potential of exoskeleton assistance in children [6-9], this paper explores the ability of an exoskeleton to improve the kinematics and mobility of an adult participant during level-ground walking. As shown in [10], crouch gait is characterized by a substantially flexed nominal knee angle throughout the gait cycle, and a substantially decreased range of motion of the knee. This deviation from healthy patterns is accompanied also by a more dorsiflexed average ankle angle, and a reduced ankle range of motion. Unlike knee and ankle motion, sagittal plane motion of the hip is quite similar to that exhibited during healthy gait","id":"abfd52fd-2527-4cc1-a734-be9f6eac4db3"}

Gregg2,3  Abstract—This paper presents the design and validation of a backdrivable powered knee orthosis for partial assistance of lower-limb musculature, which aims to facilitate daily activities in individuals with musculoskeletal disorders. The actuator design is guided by design principles that prioritize backdrivability, output torque, and compactness. First, we show that increasing the motor diameter while reducing the gear ratio for a ﬁxed output torque ultimately reduces the reﬂected inertia (and thus back- drive torque). We also identify a tradeoff with actuator torque density that can be addressed by improving the motor’s thermal environment, motivating our design of a custom Brushless DC motor with encapsulated windings. Finally, by designing a 7:1 planetary gearset directly into the stator, the actuator has a high package factor that reduces size and weight. Benchtop tests verify that the custom actuator can produce at least 23.9 Nm peak torque and 12.78 Nm continuous torque, yet has less than 2.68 Nm backdrive torque during walking conditions. Able- bodied human subjects experiments (N=3) demonstrate reduced quadriceps activation with bilateral orthosis assistance during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. The minimal transmission also produces negligible acoustic noise.  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"752f89a2-7883-4b42-b21a-f9cd6eb772a1"}

Shorter, Student Member, IEEE, Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE    Abstract—Human joint impedance describes the dynamic relationship between perturbation induced change in position and the resulting response torque. Understanding the natural regulation of ankle impedance during locomotion is necessary to discern how humans interact with their environments, and provide a foundation for the design of biomimetic assistive devices and their control systems. This study estimates ankle impedance during terminal stance phase of walking using a parametric model consisting of stiffness, damping, and inertia. The model accurately described ankle torque, accounting for 90% ± 7.7% of the variance. Stiffness was found to decrease linearly from 3.7 to 2.1 Nm\/rad\/kg between 75% and 85% stance. Quasi-stiffness—the slope of the ankle’s torque-angle curve— showed a similar decreasing trend but was significantly larger at the onset of terminal stance phase. The damping component of impedance was constant during terminal stance phase, and was increased relative to values previously reported during early and in mid-stance phase, preparation for toe-off. Inertia estimates were consistent with previously reported inertia values for the human ankle. This study bridges a gap in our understanding of ankle impedance during walking, and provides new insight into how ankle is regulated during regions when substantial impedance mechanical energy is added.  indicating an  increase  in damping","id":"20da7dc0-1810-4b9b-b916-667ce39d761f"}

Kuiken, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Human joint impedance is the dynamic relationship between the differential change in the position of a perturbed joint and the corresponding response torque; it is a fundamental property that governs how humans interact with their environ- ments. It is critical to characterize ankle impedance during the stance phase of walking to elucidate how ankle impedance is reg- ulated during locomotion, as well as provide the foundation for future development of natural, biomimetic powered prostheses and their control systems. In this study, ankle impedance was estimated using a model consisting of stiffness, damping and in- ertia. Ankle torque was well described by the model, accounting % of the variance. When averaged across subjects, for the stiffness component of impedance was found to increase linearly from 1.5 to 6.5 Nm\/rad\/kg between 20% and 70% of stance phase. The damping component was found to be statisti- cally greater than zero only for the estimate at 70% of stance phase, with a value of 0.03 Nms\/rad\/kg. The slope of the ankle’s torque-angle curve—known as the quasi-stiffness—was not sta- tistically different from the ankle stiffness values, and showed remarkable similarity. Finally, using the estimated impedance, the speciﬁcations for a biomimetic powered ankle prosthesis were introduced that would accurately emulate human ankle impedance during locomotion.  I.

This technique has been used to produce large reductions in energy expenditure during walking with exoskeletons but has not yet been applied to prosthetic devices. In this series of case studies, we applied human-in-the-loop optimization to the control of an active ankle-foot prosthesis used by amputation. We participants with unilateral optimized the parameters of five control architectures that captured aspects of successful exoskeletons and commercial prostheses, but none resulted in significantly lower metabolic rate than generic control. In one control architecture, we increased the exposure time per condition by a factor of five, but the optimized controller still resulted in higher metabolic rate. Finally, we optimized for self-reported comfort instead the resulting controller was not of metabolic rate, but preferred. There are several reasons why human-in-the-loop optimization may have failed for people with amputation. Control architecture is an unlikely cause given the variety of controllers tested. The lack of effect likely relates to changes in motor adaptation, learning, or objectives in people with amputation. Future work should investigate these potential causes to determine whether human-in-the-loop optimization for prostheses could be successful.

First published July 9, 2015; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.01133.2014.—Techniques proposed for as- sisting locomotion with exoskeletons have often included a combina- tion of active work input and passive torque support, but the physio- logical effects of different assistance techniques remain unclear. We performed an experiment to study the independent effects of net exoskeleton work and average exoskeleton torque on human locomo- tion. Subjects wore a unilateral ankle exoskeleton and walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m·s1 while net exoskeleton work rate was system- atically varied from 0.054 to 0.25 J·kg1·s1, with constant (0.12 N·m·kg1) average exoskeleton torque, and while average exoskele- ton torque was systematically varied from approximately zero to 0.18 N·m·kg1, with approximately zero net exoskeleton work. We mea- sured metabolic rate, center-of-mass mechanics, joint mechanics, and muscle activity. Both techniques reduced effort-related measures at the assisted ankle, but this form of work input reduced metabolic cost (17% with maximum net work input) while this form of torque support increased metabolic cost (13% with maximum average torque). Disparate effects on metabolic rate seem to be due to cascading effects on whole body coordination, particularly related to assisted ankle muscle dynamics and the effects of trailing ankle behavior on leading leg mechanics during double support. It would be difﬁcult to predict these results using simple walking models without muscles or musculoskeletal models that assume ﬁxed kinematics or kinetics. Data from this experiment can be used to improve predictive models of human neuromuscular adaptation and guide the design of assistive devices.  biomechanics; locomotion; ankle foot orthosis; gait; rehabilitation","id":"c2b2138a-3f3a-4c36-a7aa-b206f25da5d6"}

Gregg, and Maani Ghaffari  Abstract—Powered prosthetic legs must anticipate the user’s intent when switching between different locomotion modes (e.g., level walking, stair ascent\/descent, ramp ascent\/descent). Numerous data-driven classiﬁcation techniques have demon- strated promising results for predicting user intent, but the performance of these intent prediction models on novel subjects remains undesirable. In other domains (e.g., image classiﬁca- tion), transfer learning has improved classiﬁcation accuracy by using previously learned features from a large dataset (i.e., pre-trained models) and then transferring this learned model to a new task where a smaller dataset is available. In this paper, we develop a deep convolutional neural network with intra-subject (subject-dependent) and inter-subject (subject- independent) validations based on a human locomotion dataset. We then apply transfer learning for the subject-independent model using a small portion (10%) of the data from the left-out subject. We compare the performance of these three models. Our results indicate that the transfer learning (TL) model outperforms the subject-independent (IND) model and is comparable to the subject-dependent (DEP) model (DEP Error: 0.74 ± 0.002%, IND Error: 11.59 ± 0.076%, TL Error: 3.57 ± 0.02% with 10% data). Moreover, as expected, transfer learning accuracy increases with the availability of more data from the left-out subject. We also evaluate the performance of the intent prediction system in various sensor conﬁgurations that may be available in a prosthetic leg application. Our results suggest that a thigh IMU on the the prosthesis is sufﬁcient to predict locomotion intent in practice.  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"013e5894-1aac-4718-9090-a814afde4a7d"}

The orthotic compo- nents consist of electromechanical joints that lock and unlock automatically to provide upright stability and free movement powered by FES. Preliminary results from a prototype device on nondisabled and SCI volunteers are presented. A novel vari- able coupling hip-reciprocating mechanism either acts as a standard reciprocating gait orthosis or allows each hip to inde- pendently lock or rotate freely. Rotary actuators at each hip are configured in a closed hydraulic circuit and regulated by a finite state postural controller based on real-time sensor infor- mation. The knee mechanism locks during stance to prevent collapse and unlocks during swing, while the ankle is con- strained to move in the sagittal plane under FES-only control. The trunk is fixed in a rigid corset, and new ankle and trunk mechanisms are under development. Because the exoskeletal control mechanisms were built from off-the-shelf components, weight and cosmesis specifications for clinical use have not been met, although the power requirements are low enough to provide more than 4 hours of continuous operation with standard camcorder batteries.

We introduce a task-agnostic controller that assists the user on the basis of instantaneous estimates of lower-limb biological joint moments from a deep neural network. By estimating both hip and knee moments in-the-loop, our approach provided multi-joint, coordinated assistance through our autonomous, clothing-integrated exoskeleton. When deployed during 28 activities, spanning cyclic locomotion to unstructured tasks (for example, passive meandering and high-speed lateral cutting), the network accurately estimated hip and knee moments with an average R2 of 0.83 relative to ground truth. Further, our approach significantly outperformed a best-case task classifier-based method constructed from splines and impedance parameters. When tested on ten activities (including level walking, running, lifting a 25 lb (roughly 11 kg) weight and lunging), our controller significantly reduced user energetics (metabolic cost or lower-limb biological joint work depending on the task) relative to the zero torque condition, ranging from 5.3 to 19.7%, without any manual controller modifications among activities. Thus, this task-agnostic controller can enable exoskeletons to aid users across a broad spectrum of human activities, a necessity for real-world viability.","id":"a07ad7f2-3ef5-44d9-bfaf-61dceb8a6c7e"}

However, the performance of traditional deep learning mod- els is limited by the depth of networks, which is directly related to the training consumption. In addition, the pa- rameters of networks can only be updated by retraining when faced with newly acquired data. To address the above problems, an incremental learning method based on a tem- poral cascade broad learning system (TCBLS) is proposed for the RUL prediction of machinery with newly acquired data. Speciﬁcally, linear and nonlinear feature information is ﬁrst learned by the TCBLS. The ridge regression method is developed to calculate the weights of the network and establish an end-to-end mapping between the feature in- formation layer and the prediction layer. Finally, the incre- mental learning of new data and the incremental learning of nodes are proposed for adaptively updating the weights of the network in the face of newly acquired data and insufﬁcient prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is veriﬁed by four run-to-failure datasets. The comparison results with classical deep learning mod- els show that the proposed method is promising for RUL prediction as it achieves high prediction accuracy while saving training time consumption across orders of magni- tude and effectively handling newly acquired data without retraining.

The general control structure consists of two control loops: a motor control loop, which utilizes joint angle feedback control to control the output of the joint motor to track the desired joint trajecto- ries, and a muscle control loop, which utilizes joint torque proﬁles from previous steps to shape the muscle stimulation proﬁle for the subsequent step in order to minimize the motor torque contribu- tion required for joint angle trajectory tracking.

The efficacy of combining these efforts is experimentally validated with a series of weighted leg lift maneuvers.

I. INTRODUCTION A number of interventions have been developed to facilitate legged mobility in paraplegics. Passive approaches for legged mobility assistance include leg braces, knee-ankle-foot-orthoses (KAFOs), and reciprocating-gait-orthoses (RGOs). In an effort to improve upon these approaches, researchers have used sources of power to facilitate legged locomotion. Such sources of power can generally be categorized as either metabolic or external. Specifically, a number of researchers have investigated the use of functional electrical stimulation (FES) to artificially control leg muscle contraction, thereby utilizing the metabolic power supply of the paraplegic subject to facilitate legged locomotion. Some of the research efforts in this regard include [1-3]. Note that, in addition to providing power for locomotion, FES-aided gait has also been shown to provide a number of associated physiological benefits, some of which include increased muscle strength, increased bone density, decreased spasticity, and improved cardiovascular health [4-6]. Despite this, FES-based systems entail a number of challenges; most notably, (1) in the absence of adequate sensory information muscles are difficult to control, and (2) the rapid muscle fatigue promote by the synchronous recruitment of muscle fibers occurred in FES. Rather than utilize the metabolic power source provided by stimulated muscle, other researchers have developed lower limb exoskeletons, which utilize external power (e.g., a battery pack) to provide a source of motive power to facilitate legged locomotion. Some of the efforts in this regard include [7-15]. This approach avoids the controllability and fatigue issues associated with FES, but such approaches do not offer the physiological benefits associated with FES, and also","id":"f6f50518-ce13-43dc-9b41-a684f99559ac"}

Assisting hip extension with a tethered exosuit and a simulation-optimized force profile reduces metabolic cost of running.  Through evolution, our human species has become remarkably good at distance running thanks to long spring-like tendons in the legs and hairless skin for optimal thermoregulation. Studies have shown that distance running per- formance is linearly correlated with metabolic cost, and there has been an increased interest in the robotics community to develop wear- able exoskeletons to further augment human performance by reducing metabolic cost.  The past 3 years have seen exciting break- throughs in exoskeletons that are able to reduce the metabolic cost of walking (1–4); however, to date, efforts to develop exoskel- etons that assist running have been limited, and initial studies have not yet been able to dem - onstrate reductions in metabolic cost (5, 6). One of the challenges with developing exo- skeletons to assist running is that biological joint work in running is greater than in walk- ing. Another challenge is that the metabolic cost of carrying weight at the waist or distal- ly is higher during running than during walk- ing; therefore, the metabolic penalty of the weight of an exoskeleton is more likely to offset the effects of the assistance.  Due to limited studies on assisted running, we do not yet know which joint is best in as- sisting and which moment profile is optimal. A common thought in the field of exoskele- ton research over the previous decade is that assistance profiles should mimic the biolog- ical moments. However, in recent studies on walking, it has been demonstrated that higher reductions in metabolic cost can be achieved by exploring the metabolic landscape of the wearer by conducting parameter sweeps to identify the optimal actuation profiles (1, 2, 7, 8).

Naturally, various forms of upper limb impairments can have a substantial impact on quality of life. We developed the Myoshirt, a textile-based soft wearable robot, or exomuscle, that autonomously follows the user’s movements and thereby assists the shoulder against gravity. With the Myoshirt, participants without impairments (n = 10, 5 male) experienced a delayed onset of muscular fatigue by 51.1 s (36.1%, P < 0.001), while during a functional task their muscular activity decreased by 49.1% (P < 0.001). Analogously, two participants with upper limb impairments due to a muscular dystrophy and a spinal cord injury experienced a delayed onset of muscular fatigue during unloaded arm lifts by 256.4 s (61.5%) and by 450.6 s (210.3%), respectively. Our evidence suggests that the Myoshirt is an effective tool that intuitively assists the shoulder during functional reaching tasks, with the potential of increasing the personal independence of people with upper limb impairments.  Being able to effortlessly perform activities of daily living is  essential to guarantee personal independence. Therefore, naturally, when the function of the arms is impaired due to a  congenital or acquired disorder, quality of life is challenged.  Conventionally, people with upper limb impairments are pro- vided with physio- and occupational therapy. During the training, therapists use different tools, such as weight support or strength trainers, to facilitate and amplify the impact of their work1. In the recent past, therapy robots have been introduced to comple- ment conventional therapy tools1–3. Among these, therapy robots for arm and hand function often come in the form of large, sta- tionary devices1,4–6. They serve as training tools for people with more severe impairments1.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically slow and metabolically expensive. Passive assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses are often prescribed to increase function and independence after stroke; however, walking remains highly impaired despite—and perhaps because of—their use. We sought to determine whether a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to supplement the paretic limb’s residual ability to generate both forward propulsion and ground clearance could facilitate more normal walking after stroke. Exosuits transmit mechanical power generated by actuators to a wearer through the interaction of garment-like, functional textile anchors and cable-based transmissions. We evaluated the immediate effects of an exosuit actively assisting the paretic limb of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery during treadmill and overground walking. Using controlled, treadmill-based biomechanical investigation, we demonstrate that exosuits can function in synchrony with a wearer’s paretic limb to facilitate an immediate 5.33 ± 0.91° increase in the paretic ankle’s swing phase dorsiflexion and 11 ± 3% increase in the paretic limb’s generation of forward propulsion (P < 0.05). These improvements in paretic limb function contributed to a 20 ± 4% reduction in forward propulsion interlimb asymmetry and a 10 ± 3% reduc- tion in the energy cost of walking, which is equivalent to a 32 ± 9% reduction in the metabolic burden associated with poststroke walking. Relatively low assistance (~12% of biological torques) delivered with a lightweight and nonrestrictive exosuit was sufficient to facilitate more normal walking in ambulatory individuals after stroke. Future work will focus on understanding how exosuit-induced improvements in walking performance may be leveraged to improve mobility after stroke.","id":"b762abec-8f90-4986-b433-8e1ccdc95199"}

Taha Ahmad1,2, and Robert D. Gregg2,3  Abstract—This paper presents the mechatronic design and initial validation of a partial-assist knee orthosis for individuals with musculoskeletal disorders, e.g., knee osteoarthritis and lower back pain. This orthosis utilizes a quasi-direct drive ac- tuator with a low-ratio transmission (7:1) to greatly reduce the reﬂected inertia for high backdrivability. To provide meaningful assistance, a custom Brushless DC (BLDC) motor is designed with encapsulated windings to improve the motor’s thermal environment and thus its continuous torque output. The 2.69 kg orthosis is constructed from all custom-made components with a high package factor for lighter weight and a more compact size. The combination of compactness, backdrivability, and torque output enables the orthosis to provide partial assistance without obstructing the natural movement of the user. Several benchtop tests verify the actuator’s capabilities, and a human subject experiment demonstrates reduced quadriceps muscle activation when assisted during a repetitive lifting and lowering task.  I. INTRODUCTION  Traditionally, exoskeletons (i.e., powered orthoses) aid paraplegic individuals with little to no remnant voluntary movement, e.g., following a severe stroke or spinal cord injury [1], [2]. As a result, many exoskeleton designs have focused on achieving high torque output to fully support the lower extremities. However, larger populations of individuals with musculoskeletal disorders would beneﬁt from partial assistance of their musculature rather than full assistance. This includes 27 million individuals with osteoarthritis [3] and 66 million individuals with lower back pain [4] in the USA alone. Weak quadriceps musculature is a signiﬁcant contributing factor to the persistence and progression of both conditions, a limitation that can potentially be resolved by assistive knee torques. In the case of knee osteoarthritis, the this assistance would in turn reduce high forces at patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints, ultimately reducing pain [5], [6]. Likewise, lower back pain that results from repetitive lifting and lowering (L&L) tasks could poten- tially beneﬁt from partial assistance, as fatigued quadriceps contribute to poor posture in these tasks [7]. To achieve partial assistance, several design goals must be balanced: 1) facilitation of non-hindered voluntary movement of the user","id":"854a29f0-1c94-4e56-baae-6e620cc5b991"}

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  How adaptation, training, and customization contribute to benefits from exoskeleton assistance Katherine L. Poggensee* and Steven H. Collins  Exoskeletons can enhance human mobility, but we still know little about why they are effective. For example, we do not know the relative importance of training, how much is required, or what type is most effective; how people adapt with the device; or the relative benefits of customizing assistance. We conducted experiments in which naïve users learned to walk with ankle exoskeletons under one of three training regimens characterized by differ- ent levels of variation in device behavior. Assistance was also customized for one group. After moderate-variation training, the benefits of customized assistance were large; metabolic rate was reduced by 39% compared with walking with the exoskeleton turned off. Training contributed about half of this benefit and customization about one-quarter; a generic controller reduced energy cost by 10% before training and 31% afterward. Training re- quired much more exposure than typical of exoskeleton studies, about 109 minutes of assisted walking. Type of training also had a strong effect; the low-variation group required twice as long as the moderate-variation group to become expert, and the high-variation group never acquired this level of expertise. Curiously, all users adapted in a way that resulted in less mechanical power from the exoskeleton as they gained expertise. Customizing assist- ance required less time than training for all parameters except peak torque magnitude, which grew slowly over the study, suggesting a longer time scale adaptation in the person. These results underscore the importance of training to the benefits of exoskeleton assistance and suggest the topic deserves more attention.","id":"b2c54d47-7404-4180-b18b-8f3718dacdb3"}

Herr, IEEE Member  Abstract— Although great advances have been made in the design and control of lower extremity prostheses, walking on different terrains, such as ramps or stairs, and transitioning between these terrains remains a major challenge for the field. In order to generalize biomimetic behaviour of active lower- limb prostheses top-down volitional control is required but has until recently been deemed unfeasible due to the difficulties involved in acquiring an adequate electromyographic (EMG) signal. In this study, we hypothesize that a transtibial amputee can extend the functionality of a hybrid controller, designed for level ground walking, to stair ascent and descent by volitionally modulating powered plantar-flexion of the prosthesis. We here present data illustrating that the participant is able to reproduce ankle push-off behaviour of the intrinsic controller during stair ascent as well as prevent inadvertent push-off during stair descent. Our findings suggest that EMG signal from the residual limb muscles can be used to transition between level-ground walking and stair ascent\/descent within a single step and significantly improve prosthesis performance during stair-ambulation.  We here present preliminary clinical data on a hybrid, a volitional EMG neuromuscular reflex-model framework (positive force feedback [12, 13]). Unlike previous studies, user intention is not used to derive state transitions but to proportionally control push-off by a powered ankle-foot prosthesis, as recently illustrated for level ground walking [14]. We hypothesized that volitional control enables the amputee to generalize the behavior of the level ground walking state machine to stair ascent and descent, even though walking states differ between these three types of gait [15]. In particular we hypothesized that a) the amputee would be able to produce push-off torques and toe-off ankle angles comparable to that generated using the intrinsic controller and the biological limb during stair ascent and b) to prevent inadvertent ankle push-off during stair descent.  controller  implemented within  II.

Rouse1, Luke M. Mooney2 and Hugh M. Herr1,3  Abstract Currently, the mobility of above-knee amputees is limited by the lack of available prostheses that can efficiently replicate biologically accurate movements. In this study, a powered knee prosthesis was designed utilizing a novel mechanism, known as a clutchable series-elastic actuator (CSEA).The CSEA includes a low-power clutch in parallel with an electric motor within a traditional series-elastic actuator. The stiffness of the series elasticity was tuned to match the elastically conservative region of the knee’s torque-angle relationship during the stance phase of locomotion. During this region, the clutch was used to efficiently store energy in the series elasticity. The fully autonomous knee prosthesis design utilized a brushless electric motor, ballscrew transmission and cable drive, as well as commercial electrical components. The knee was lighter than the eighth percentile and shorter than the first percentile male shank segment. The CSEA Knee was tested in a unilateral above-knee amputee walking at 1.3 m\/s. During walking, the CSEA Knee provided biomechanically accurate torque-angle behavior, agreeing within 17% of the net work and 27% of the stance flexion angle produced by the biological knee. In addition, the process of locomotion reduced the net electrical energy consumption of the CSEA Knee. The knee’s motor generated 1.8 J\/stride, and the net energy consumption was 3.6 J\/stride, an order of magnitude less energy than previously published powered knee prostheses.

To realize steady walk on stairs, the most important problem is the structure design and gait planning of lower limb exoskeleton. A novel assisted exoskeleton system was proposed based on biomechanics characteristics. The four-point segmented gait generation strategy based on cubic spline interpolation was proposed, and the gait trajectory during stair walking was described. To ensure walking stability, the constraint relationship between the swing leg and the stair step was constructed. In addition, the constraint function was constructed for stable walking in horizontal and vertical directions based on zero moment point (ZMP). Then, the multicoupled continuous dynamic primitive gait learning strategy (PIRDMPs) was proposed to achieve fine-grained learning of stair gait trajectories. Finally, the proposed method was validated by human–machine wear experiments. Compared with the dynamic motion primitive (DMP) method, the average trajectory fits for the hip and knee joints obtained based on the PIRDMPs method were increased by 11.28% and 7.17%, respectively. Also, the average deviation values of ZMP in the sagittal plane (ZMP-X) and coronal plane (ZMP-Y) of the man–machine system were reduced by 109.2 and 125.3 mm, respectively.

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Powered knee and ankle prosthesis with indirect volitional swing control enables level-ground walking and crossing over obstacles Joel Mendez, Sarah Hood, Andy Gunnel, Tommaso Lenzi*  Powered prostheses aim to mimic the missing biological limb with controllers that are finely tuned to replicate the nominal gait pattern of non-amputee individuals. Unfortunately, this control approach poses a problem with real-world ambulation, which includes tasks such as crossing over obstacles, where the prosthesis trajectory must be modified to provide adequate foot clearance and ensure timely foot placement. Here, we show an indirect volitional control approach that enables prosthesis users to walk at different speeds while smoothly and continuously crossing over obstacles of different sizes without explicit classification of the environment. At the high level, the proposed controller relies on a heuristic algorithm to continuously change the maximum knee flexion angle and the swing duration in harmony with the user’s residual limb. At the low level, minimum-jerk planning is used to continuously adapt the swing trajectory while maximizing smoothness. Experiments with three individuals with above-knee amputation show that the proposed control approach allows for volitional control of foot clearance, which is necessary to negotiate environmental barriers. Our study suggests that a powered prosthesis controller with intrinsic, volitional adaptability may provide prosthesis users with functionality that is not currently available, facilitating real-world ambulation.","id":"84d1eb26-eccb-4869-b25c-7d7a013b0007"}

To achieve greater gains in the future it will be important to determine optimal actuation parameters and explore the effect of assisting other joints. The aim of the present work is to investigate how the timing of hip extension assistance affects the positive mechanical power delivered by an exosuit and its effect on biological joint power and metabolic cost during loaded walking. In this study, we evaluated 4 different hip assistive profiles with different actuation timings: early-start-early-peak (ESEP), early-start-late-peak (ESLP), late-start-early-peak (LSEP), late-start-late-peak (LSLP). Methods: Eight healthy participants walked on a treadmill at a constant speed of 1.5 m · s-1 while carrying a 23 kg backpack load.

INTRODUCTION  Deep learning-based architectures have triggered many real-world applications such as face detection and recognition, blur image identi- ﬁcation, mandible segmentation, and speaker recognition. In general, the gradient descent is employed in tuning parameters of deep learning totrain model, and itusually need more time than expected, which have severely restricted their development.  In order to improve the generalization ability and reduce the training timeofneuralnetwork,ChenandLiu[1]proposebroadlearningsystem (BLS), which is based on the notion of random vector functional-link neural network (RVFLNN) [2]. BLS provides more ﬂexible access network and ﬂat network architecture. The parameters of feature nodes and enhancement nodes are randomly generated in the procedure of network initialization, and they are ﬁxed without any adjustment in the process of network training. All nodes of network can connect directly with the output. The ridge regression theory is used to calculate output weight of BLS. The outstanding advantage of BLS is that it can ﬁnd the globaloptimalsolution.Moreover,regularizationmethods,whichmake the results close to the true value, can effectively inhibit the distortion. In addition, it can increase feature nodes and enhancement nodes dynamically depending upon the residual error of network without retraining network.","id":"2dc97d0f-5902-4bc7-b903-f14d69907791"}

Gregg, Tommaso Lenzi, Nicholas P. Fey, Levi J. Hargrove, and Jonathon W. Sensinger  Abstract—This paper presents the design and experimental feedback control strategy that implementation of a novel regulates effective shape on a powered transfemoral prosthesis. The human effective shape is the effective geometry to which the biological leg conforms—through movement of ground reaction forces and leg joints—during the stance period of gait. Able- bodied humans regulate effective shapes to be invariant across conditions such as heel height, walking speed, and body weight, so this measure has proven to be a very useful tool for the alignment and design of passive prostheses. However, leg joints must be actively controlled to assume different effective shapes that are unique to tasks such as standing, walking, and stair climbing. Using our previous simulation studies as a starting point, we model and control the effective shape as a virtual kinematic constraint on the powered Vanderbilt prosthetic leg with a custom instrumented foot. An able-bodied subject used a by-pass adapter to walk on the controlled leg over ground and over a treadmill. These preliminary experiments demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, that effective shape (or virtual constraints in general) can be used to control a powered prosthetic leg.  I. INTRODUCTION  The effective shape of the human leg during locomotor tasks (called the rollover shape during walking) has been studied for over a decade [1] and has proven to be a very useful measure for gait analysis and prosthesis alignment [2], [3]. The effective shape is the trajectory of the center of pressure (COP)—the point on the plantar sole of the foot where the cumulative reaction force is imparted against the ground—mapped into a moving reference frame attached to the stance leg. For a rigid object, e.g., a metal wheel, the effective shape is its actual geometry. However, the effective shape of an object that includes a compliant or controllable joint—such as a human or prosthetic ankle—is variable and can be regulated, for example, within the local coordinate frame of the shank or thigh.  Able-bodied humans appear to regulate their effective shape to remain invariant across many conditions, including [3], walking speed [4], and body weight heel height [1]. This suggests the effective shape is fundamental to human locomotor control and could be useful for designing prosthetic legs that are more adaptable than conventional","id":"4df13113-0768-493c-b34c-798af6ebab7d"}

A powered stairmill, integrated with a gait rehabilitation device, can potentially be used for training those who have difﬁculty climbing stairs. In order to assess the effec- tiveness of such an approach, it is necessary to understand the similarities and differences in walking on regular stairs and on a stairmill. We have conducted an experiment to compare the differences in kine- matics and muscle activations during climbing on regular stairs and a stairmill. Twelve subjects partic- ipated in this study. They ﬁrst walked on regular stairs ﬁve times and then performed a one-minute continuous walking on a stairmill. The results showed several important differences. During continuous walking on a stairmill, when compared to regular stairs, there was (i) an increase in the percentage of stance phase during a walking cycle, (ii) a higher angle of plantarﬂexion of the ankle during the transition from stance phase to swing phase, and (iii) a decrease in muscle activation of the tibialis anterior during swing phase. These differences would provide additional insights into the design of future rehabilitation systems and to interpret human data obtained from stairmills.   2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.  1.

A dynamic kinematics-driven approach was employed accounting for the spinal synergy by simultaneous consideration of passive structures and muscle forces under given posture and loads.

Tree-based BLS (TBLS) is designed for small data modeling by introducing nondifferentiable modules and an ensemble strategy to the traditional broad learning system (BLS). TBLS replaces the neurons of BLS with the tree modules to map the input data. Moreover, we present three new TBLS variant methods and their incremental learning implementations, which are motivated by deep, broad, and ensemble learning. Their major distinction is reﬂected in the incremental learning strategies based on: 1) mean square error (mse); 2) pseudo- inverse; and 3) pseudo-inverse theory and stack representation. Therefore, this study further explores the domain of BLS based on the nondifferentiable modules. The simulations are compared with some state-of-the-art (SOTA) BLS-NN and tree methods under high-, medium-, and low-dimensional benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the BLS-NN, and the modeling accuracy is remarkably improved with the small training data of the proposed TBLS.

When defining requirements for any wearable robot for walking assistance, it is important to maximize the user’s metabolic benefit resulting from the exosuit assistance while limiting the metabolic penalty of carrying the system’s mass. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the relationship between assistance magnitude and the metabolic cost of walking while also examining changes to the wearer’s underlying gait mechanics. The study was performed with a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit during normal walking, where assistance was di- rectly applied at the ankle joint and indirectly at the hip due to a textile architecture. The exosuit controller was designed such that the delivered torque profile at the ankle joint approximated that of the biological torque during normal walking. Seven participants walked on a treadmill at 1.5 meters per second under one unpowered and four powered conditions, where the peak moment applied at the ankle joint was varied from about 10 to 38% of biological ankle moment (equivalent to an applied force of 18.7 to 75.0% of body weight). Results showed that, with increasing exosuit assistance, net metabolic rate continually decreased within the tested range. When maximum assistance was applied, the metabolic rate of walking was reduced by 22.83 ± 3.17% relative to the powered-off condition (mean ± SEM).  INTRODUCTION Humans naturally walk in a manner that conserves energy; we opti- mize our cadence, step length, and arm swing to minimize metabolic energy consumption (1, 2). It is a commonly held belief that devia- tions from this normal walking pattern increase energy expenditure (3, 4). Certain diseases that affect gait, such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy, increase the net energy expenditure of walking by as much as 70% compared with healthy individuals (5–7). In addition, the energy expenditure of healthy individuals increases under strenuous activities, such as walking uphill or carrying heavy loads (8, 9). Such increases in metabolic consumption could lead to greater levels of fatigue and injury. For patient populations, the added effort could also decrease community involvement.","id":"22c71574-ad2f-4a42-bef8-dc3dad88234c"}

The CNN structure is a kind of multilayer neural networks with convolution and pooling operations as feature mapping that can be considered to have the similar feature extraction property with properly adjusted weights. One may also con- sider that the feature mapping portion is a kind of kernel mappings, in which different kernels may be used to replace convolution and pooling operators. CNN and its variants have successfully accomplished a very high recognition rate in many recognition competitions tested on ImageNet data set.  Although the deep structure has been so powerful, most networks suffer from time-consuming training process because complicated structures are involved. Many of the studies require high-performance computing and powerful facility. Moreover, this complication makes it so difﬁcult to analyze the deep structure theoretically that most work spans in turning the parameters or stacking more layers for better accuracy.  I.

Real-time gait event detec- tion is executed with an inertial measurement unit based on an onboard trained model. Two models are trained based on the collected data from the knee exoskeleton at normal walk- ing speed under zero torque and assistive torque control modes, respectively. We conduct two experiments: 1) real-time detec- tion experiments under zero torque control at different speeds and 2) real-time detection and assistive torque control experi- ments based on real-time detection results at different speeds. Five able-bodied subjects participated in the experiments. The recognition accuracy and assistive torque performances based on real-time detection are evaluated. The experimental results show that all the critical gait events are detected rightly and the delay of gait event detection does not lead to damage to the overall system of knee exoskeleton. In addition, in real-time detection and assistive torque control experiments, parameters of the con- troller are refreshed for the current cycle based on the previous gait cycle, which is reasonable according to the detection result. The tracking performance of the torque could meet the require- ment. This paper provides a feasible and applicable method for knee exoskeleton control based on real-time gait event detection.

Gregg , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—This article presents the design and validation of a backdrivable powered knee orthosis for partial assis- tance of lower-limb musculature, which aims to facilitate daily activities in individuals with musculoskeletal disor- ders. The actuator design is guided by design principles that prioritize backdrivability, output torque, and compact- ness. First, we show that increasing the motor diameter while reducing the gear ratio for a ﬁxed output torque ul- timately reduces the reﬂected inertia (and thus backdrive torque). We also identify a tradeoff with actuator torque density that can be addressed by improving the motor’s thermal environment, motivating our design of a custom brushless dc motor with encapsulated windings. Finally, by designing a 7:1 planetary gearset directly into the stator, the actuator has a high package factor that reduces size and weight. Benchtop tests verify that the custom actua- tor can produce at least 23.9-N · m peak torque and 12.78- N · m continuous torque, yet has less than 2.68-N · m back- drive torque during walking conditions. Able-bodied human subject experiments (N = 3) demonstrate reduced quadri- cep activation with bilateral orthosis assistance during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing.

Despite recent advances, few products are commercially available and exoskeleton research is still often limited by hardware constraints. Many promising multi-joint assistance strategies, especially those with high- torque and high-power components, have yet to be tested because they are beyond the capabilities of current devices. To study these untested assistance strategies, we present a hip–knee–ankle exoskeleton emulator that can apply high torques and powers that match or exceed those observed in uphill running. The system has powerful off-board motors that actuate a 13.5 kg exoskeleton end effector worn by the user. It can apply up to 200 Nm of torque in hip flexion, hip extension, and ankle plantarflexion, 250 Nm of torque in knee extension, and 140 Nm of torque in knee flexion, with over 4.5 kW of power at each joint and a closed-loop torque bandwidth of at least 18 Hz in each direction of actuation. The exoskeleton is compliant in unactuated directions, adjustable for a wide range of users and comfortable during walking and running. When paired with human-in-the-loop optimization, we expect that this system will identify new assistance strategies to improve human mobility.

Few studies have reported the biomechanical aspects of stair climbing for this ergonomically demanding task. The pur- pose of this ethically approved study was to identify normal functional parameters of the lower limb during stair climbing and to com- pare the actions of stair ascent and descent in young healthy individuals.  Methods. Thirty-three young healthy subjects, (16 M, 17 F, range 18–39 years) participated in the study. The laboratory staircase consisted of four steps (rise height 18 cm, tread length 28.5 cm). Kinematic data were recorded using 3D motion analysis system. Tem- poral gait cycle data and ground reaction forces were recorded using a force platform. Kinetic data were standardized to body mass and height.  Findings. Paired-samples t tests showed signiﬁcantly greater hip and knee angles (mean diﬀerence standard deviation (SD): hip 28.10 (SD 4.08), knee 3.39 (SD 7.20)) and hip and knee moments (hip 0.25 N m\/kg (SD 0.18), knee 0.17 N m\/kg (SD 0.15)) during stair ascent compared to descent. Signiﬁcantly greater ankle dorsiﬂexion angles (9.90 (SD 3.80)) and plantarﬂexion angles (8.78 (SD 4.80)) were found during stair descent compared to ascent. Coeﬃcient of variation (mean (SD)) in percentage between repeated tests varied for joint angles and moments, respectively (2.35% (SD 1.83)–17.53% (SD 13.62)) and (4.65% (SD 2.99)–40.73% (SD 24.77)).  Interpretation. Stair ascent was shown to be the more demanding biomechanical task when compared to stair descent for healthy young subjects.

Detection of IEDs is signiﬁ- cant for the diagnosis of epilepsy and the prediction of seizures. In this letter, we proposed a graph convolutional network and bi-directional LSTM co-embedded broad learning system to detect IEDS.

In addition, bi-directional LSTM is also adopted for extracting the temporal feature from signals. Then these features are incorpo- rated into Broad Learning System (BLS) to automatically detect epileptiform events.

Moreover, Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) have been a biomarker for neurologists to diagnose epilepsy and predict seizures, which are the main target of clinical EEG interpretation [3]. It usually appears as sharp waves, spikes, or spike-wave-complexes in EEG [4]. Currently, the detection of IEDs is mainly done manually by neurologists. However, visual evaluation has various limitations, such as time-consuming reviews, interobserver variability, requirement of highly experienced and skilled neurologists [5], [6]. Hence, it is a necessary to develop an automated IEDs detection system. Some attempts have already been made to detect IEDs from scalp EEG signals, including morphology-based [7], [8], signal correlation-based [9], [10], feature engineering-based [11], and time-frequency decomposition-based [12], or the ensemble of multiple methods [13]. Due to the huge morphological differ- ence of spikes across patients and the subjectivity of neurolo- gists’ criteria, none of these methods can achieve universally accepted results [14], [15].  I.

INTRODUCTION Observe gait is clinically important to allow physical therapists (PT) and clinicians to assess motor deficits in patients. However, the inconsistent results in the skill of visual assessment lead to a question about whether clinicians are accurate and reliable on gait judgment[1, 2]. Also, little is known about which gait features would base accurate judgments. The purpose of this study is to investigate (1) the differences in observational gait analysis skill between those with different level of clinical experience and (2) the kinematics features informative for perceiving amputee gait. We introduced a new method that combines biological motion and principal component analysis (PCA) to gradually mesh amputee and typical walking patterns for raters to rank. The synthesized patterns preserved the kinematics features that allow physical therapists (PT), PT students (PTS), and novice raters to discriminate different levels of gait impairment. This method can be used to train and evaluate observational gait analysis of PTs, physicians, and prosthetists. In addition, the identified gait features that PTs attended to might inform the future design of automated, clinically relevant gait evaluation and automatic prosthesis tuning algorithm in the future.

Lerner, Diane L. Damiano, and Thomas C. Bulea, Member, IEEE  Abstract—Individuals with cerebral palsy frequently exhibit crouch gait, a pathological walking pattern characterized by excessive knee ﬂexion. Knowledge of the knee joint moment during crouch gait is necessary for the design and control of assistive devices used for treatment. Our goal was to 1) develop statistical models to estimate knee joint moment extrema and dynamic stiffness during crouch gait, and 2) use the models to es- timate the instantaneous joint moment during weight-acceptance. We retrospectively computed knee moments from 10 children with crouch gait and used stepwise linear regression to develop statistical models describing the knee moment features. The models explained at least 90% of the response value variability: peak moment in early (99%) and late (90%) stance, and dy- namic stiffness of weight-acceptance ﬂexion (94%) and extension (98%). We estimated knee extensor moment proﬁles from the predicted dynamic stiffness and instantaneous knee angle. This approach captured the timing and shape of the computed moment (root-mean-squared error: 2.64 Nm); including the predicted early-stance peak moment as a correction factor improved model performance (root-mean-squared error: 1.37 Nm). Our strategy provides a practical, accurate method to estimate the knee mo- ment during crouch gait, and could be used for real-time, adaptive control of robotic orthoses.

Back- support devices have been developed to mitigate these injuries by aiding workers during lifting tasks. However, existing devices often fall short in providing multidimensional force assistance for asymmetric lifting, an essential feature for practical workplace use. In addition, validation of device safety across the entire human spine has been lacking. This paper introduces the Bilateral Back Extensor Exosuit (BBEX), a robotic back- support device designed to address both functionality and safety concerns. The design of the BBEX draws inspiration from the anatomical characteristics of the human spine and back extensor muscles. Using a multi–degree- of- freedom architecture and serially connected linear actuators, the device’s components are strategically arranged to closely mimic the bio- mechanics of the human spine and back extensor muscles. To establish the efficacy and safety of the BBEX, a series of experiments with human participants was conducted. Eleven healthy male participants engaged in symmetric and asymmetric lifting tasks while wearing the BBEX. The results confirm the ability of the BBEX to provide effec- tive multidimensional force assistance. Moreover, comprehensive safety validation was achieved through analy- ses of muscle fatigue in the upper and the lower erector spinae muscles, as well as mechanical loading on spinal joints during both lifting scenarios. By seamlessly integrating functionality inspired by human biomechanics with a focus on safety, this study offers a promising solution to address the persistent challenge of preventing lumbar spine injuries in demanding work environments.","id":"2936ec0b-661d-4df7-845f-e0693e870c45"}

Walsh1,2  , Denise Martineli Rossi1,2,4, Christopher Siviy1,2, Sangjun Lee1,2,  Abstract  Background: Different groups developed wearable robots for walking assistance, but there is still a need for methods to quickly tune actuation parameters for each robot and population or sometimes even for individual users. Protocols where parameters are held constant for multiple minutes have traditionally been used for evaluating responses to parameter changes such as metabolic rate or walking symmetry. However, these discrete protocols are time-consuming. Recently, protocols have been proposed where a parameter is changed in a continuous way. The aim of the present study was to compare effects of continuously varying assistance magnitude with a soft exosuit against discrete step conditions.  Methods: Seven participants walked on a treadmill wearing a soft exosuit that assists plantarflexion and hip flexion. In Continuous-up, peak exosuit ankle moment linearly increased from approximately 0 to 38% of biological moment over 10 min. Continuous-down was the opposite. In Discrete, participants underwent five periods of 5 min with steady peak moment levels distributed over the same range as Continuous-up and Continuous-down. We calculated metabolic rate for the entire Continuous-up and Continuous-down conditions and the last 2 min of each Discrete force level. We compared kinematics, kinetics and metabolic rate between conditions by curve fitting versus peak moment. Results: Reduction in metabolic rate compared to Powered-off was smaller in Continuous-up than in Continuous- down at most peak moment levels, due to physiological dynamics causing metabolic measurements in Continuous- up and Continuous-down to lag behind the values expected during steady-state testing. When evaluating the average slope of metabolic reduction over the entire peak moment range there was no significant difference between Continuous-down and Discrete.

To conquer these challenges, after many iterations and in- depth investigations, we have meticulously developed a full-size humanoid robot, “Adam”, whose innovative structural design greatly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the imitation learning process. In addition, we have developed a novel imita- tion learning framework based on an adversarial motion prior, which applies not only to Adam but also to humanoid robots in general. Using the framework, Adam can exhibit unprecedented human-like characteristics in locomotion tasks. Our experimen- tal results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables Adam to achieve human-comparable performance in complex locomotion tasks, marking the first time that human locomotion data has been used for imitation learning in a full-size humanoid robot.

Young  Abstract—Estimating biological joint moments using wearable sensors could enable out-of-lab biomechanical analyses and exoskeletons that assist throughout daily life. To realize these possibilities, this study introduced a subject-independent hip moment estimator using a temporal convolutional network (TCN) and validated its performance and generalizability during multimodal ambulation. Electrogoniometer and simulated IMU data from sixteen participants walking on level ground, ramps and stairs were used to evaluate our approach when benchmarked against a fully-connected neural network, a long short-term memory network, and a baseline method (i.e., using subject- average moment curves based on ambulation mode and gait phase). Additionally, the generalizability of our approach was evaluated by testing on ground slopes, stair heights, and gait training. The TCN transitions withheld during model outperformed the benchmark approaches on the hold-out data (p<0.05), with an average RMSE of 0.131±0.018 Nm\/kg and R2 of 0.880±0.030 during steady-state ambulation. When tested on the 20 leave-one-out slope and stair height conditions, the TCN significantly increased RMSE only on the steepest (+18°) incline (p<0.05). Finally, the TCN RMSE and R2 was 0.152±0.027 Nm\/kg and 0.786±0.055, respectively, during mode transitions. Thus, our approach accurately estimated hip moment and generalized to unseen gait contexts using data from three wearable sensors.

Stair Ascent Phase-Variable Control of a Powered Knee-Ankle Prosthesis  Ross J. Cortino,  Edgar Bolívar-Nieto,  T. Kevin Best,  Robert D. Gregg  Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Robotics Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.  Abstract  Passive prostheses cannot provide the net positive work required at the knee and ankle for step- over stair ascent. Powered prostheses can provide this net positive work, but user synchronization of joint motion and power input are critical to enabling natural stair ascent gaits. In this work, we build on previous phase variable-based control methods for walking and propose a stair ascent controller driven by the motion of the user’s residual thigh. We use reference kinematics from an able-bodied dataset to produce knee and ankle joint trajectories parameterized by gait phase. We redefine the gait cycle to begin at the point of maximum hip flexion instead of heel strike to improve the phase estimate. Able-bodied bypass adapter experiments demonstrate that the phase variable controller replicates normative able-bodied kinematic trajectories with a root mean squared error of 12.66° and 2.64° for the knee and ankle, respectively. The knee and ankle joints provided on average 0.39 J\/kg and 0.21 J\/kg per stride, compared to the normative averages of 0.34 J\/kg and 0.21 J\/kg, respectively. Thus, this controller allows powered knee-ankle prostheses to perform net positive mechanical work to assist stair ascent.  I.  Introduction","id":"0517a12c-3f9d-4182-bbcb-ba68cbaf6001"}

No claim to original U.S. Government Works  Zachary F. Lerner, Diane L. Damiano, Thomas C. Bulea*  The ability to walk contributes considerably to physical health and overall well-being, particularly in children with motor disability, and is therefore prioritized as a rehabilitation goal. However, half of ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent childhood movement disorder, cease to walk in adulthood. Robotic gait trainers have shown positive outcomes in initial studies, but these clinic-based systems are limited to short- term programs of insufficient length to maintain improved function in a lifelong disability such as CP. Sophisticated wearable exoskeletons are now available, but their utility in treating childhood movement dis- orders remains unknown. We evaluated an exoskeleton for the treatment of crouch (or flexed-knee) gait, one of the most debilitating pathologies in CP. We show that the exoskeleton reduced crouch in a cohort of ambula- tory children with CP during overground walking. The exoskeleton was safe and well tolerated, and all children were able to walk independently with the device. Rather than guiding the lower limbs, the exoskeleton dynam- ically changed the posture by introducing bursts of knee extension assistance during discrete portions of the walking cycle, a perturbation that resulted in maintained or increased knee extensor muscle activity during exoskeleton use. Six of seven participants exhibited postural improvements equivalent to outcomes reported from invasive orthopedic surgery. We also demonstrate that improvements in crouch increased over the course of our multiweek exploratory trial. Together, these results provide evidence supporting the use of wearable exoskeletons as a treatment strategy to improve walking in children with CP.","id":"4094a703-5030-44a2-9210-896044439fb7"}

Some common metrics exist for evaluating these systems, such as metabolic cost, but they are incomplete with regards to the many other characteristics to be compared between systems. To this end, we are developing holistic test methods, speciﬁcally those for lower body wearable robots focused on performance augmentation. We discuss the test methods’ structure, considerations, and development. Prototypes of the test methods have been exercised with a user wearing a B-Temia Dermoskeleton system. Our initial development has led to a baseline set of basic and applied tasks that can be evaluated comparatively between performing the task without and with the system, measuring simple task-based metrics based on time, repetitions, loading capacity, and range of motion. Future work includes exercising the test methods with more wearable robotic systems and formulating a working task group to assist in driving development.  I.  INTRODUCTION  Wearable robots and exoskeletons are a growing technol- ogy that has seen rapid growth in recent years. The most common use of the modern day wearable robot is in medical rehabilitation, with exoskeletons such as the ReWalk 6.0 [1] and the Ekso GT [2], helping users regain limb control and movement while recovering from an injury. Exoskeleton sys- tems are also used in the commercial space with exoskeletons such as the Ekso Works [2], demonstrating use in construction and industrial environments by providing passive augmentation to an able bodied user. For military use, exoskeletons from the Warrior Web Program [3] and the B-Temia Dermoskeleton [4] (see Figure 1), are providing active human augmentation to able bodied users, to extend and improve task performance.

We propose a new method combining the strengths of traditional laboratory studies where environment is strictly controlled, and ﬁeld-based studies where subjects behave naturally. We use a foot-mounted inertial sensor, a GPS receiver and a barometric altitude sensor to reconstruct a subject’s path and detailed foot movement, both indoors and outdoors, during days-long measurement using strapdown navigation and sensor fusion algorithms. We cluster repeated movement paths based on location, and propose that on these paths, most environmental and behavioral factors (e.g., terrain and motivation) are as repeatable as in a laboratory. During each bout of movement along a frequently repeated path, any synchronized measurement can be isolated for study, enabling focused statistical comparison of diﬀerent interventions. We conducted a 10-day test on one subject wearing athletic shoes and sandals each for ﬁve days. The algorithm detected four frequently-repeated straight walking paths with at least 300 total steps and repetitions on at least three days for each condition. Results on these frequently-repeated paths indicated signiﬁcantly lower foot clearance and shorter stride length and a trend toward decreased stride width when wearing athletic shoes vs. sandals. Comparisons based on all straight walking were similar, showing greater statistical power, but higher variability in the data. The proposed method oﬀers a new way to evaluate how mobility interventions aﬀect everyday movement behavior.

Keya Ghonasgi, Jiyeon Kang, and Sunil K. Agrawal*  Abstract— In a previous study, a Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) was used to successfully retrain crouch gait of children with Cerebral Palsy by applying a downward force on the pelvis during walking on a treadmill. While the results of this study were promising, an important issue was translating these results to special needs children with crouch gait using simpler alternative procedures. This motivates the present study to compare the biomechanical differences in walking under two conditions: (i) the TPAD applies a pure downward force on the pelvis using tethers, and (ii) a weighted pelvic belt is used to apply the same downward force on the pelvis. In the second case the weight belt also increases the mass at the pelvis.  Ten healthy subjects performed two separate experiments while walking on an instrumented treadmill. The whole-body kinematics was recorded using a motion capture system and the ground reaction forces were measured by force plates embedded in the treadmill. We found no significant difference in the actual gait parameters of healthy subjects when the downwards force, equivalent to 15% body weight, applied by the TPAD was replaced by a weighted pelvic belt of 15% body weight. However, the estimated maximum ankle torque, predicted by an inverted pendulum mathematical model, during the single support phase showed a higher increase during walking with the weight belt when compared to a pure downward force. This suggests that the weight belt, due to its simplicity, may be a better medium to translate the results of TPAD in children with cerebral palsy who have a crouch gait.  I. INTRODUCTION Human walking has been studied extensively over the years. Simplified inverted pendulum models have been proposed to predict the human gait and estimate stability using the Zero Moment Point [1]. However, it is still a challenge to satisfactorily predict walking under different experimental conditions.  vertical direction and propulsion of Inertial Mass (IM) in the direction of progression, are of particular interest during a gait cycle.

However, understanding of the effects of resisting plantarflexion during stance on joint kinetics and muscle activity—key outcomes in evaluating its potential value in rehabilitation—remains limited. This initial study uses a unilateral exosuit that resists plantarflexion during mid-late stance in unimpaired individuals to test the hypotheses that when plantarflexion is resisted, individuals would (1) increase plantarflexor ankle torque and muscle activity locally at the resisted ipsilateral ankle, but (2) at higher forces, exhibit a generalized response that also uses the unresisted joints and limb. Further, we expected (3) short-term retention into gait immediately after removal of resistance. Methods: Ten healthy young adults walked at 1.25 m s− exposure to active exosuit-applied resistance, and post-active sections. In each bout, a different force magnitude was applied based on individual baseline ankle torques. The peak resistance torque applied by the exosuit was 0.13 0.01, 0.19 1 Results: (1) Across all bouts, participants increased peak ipsilateral biological ankle torque by 0.13–0.25 N m kg− (p < 0.001) during exosuit-applied resistance compared to corresponding baselines. Additionally, ipsilateral soleus activity during stance increased by 5.4–11.3% (p < 0.05) in all but the LOW bout. (2) In the HIGH and MAX bouts, vertical ground reaction force decreased on the ipsilateral limb while increasing on the contralateral limb (p < 0.01). Secondary analysis found that the force magnitude that maximized increases in biological ankle torque without significant changes in limb loading varied by subject.

Holt, Conor Walsh, Member, IEEE  Abstract--- To understand the effects of soft exosuits on human loaded walking, we developed a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide synchronized forces to the ankle and hip joints. Two different assistive strategies were evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.25 m\/s with a 23.8 kg backpack: 1) hip extension assistance and 2) multi-joint assistance (hip extension, ankle plantarflexion and hip flexion). Results show that the exosuit introduces minimum changes to kinematics and reduces biological joint moments. A reduction trend in muscular activity was observed for both conditions. On average, the exosuit reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 0.21 ± 0.04 W\/kg and 0.67 ± 0.09 W\/kg for hip extension assistance and multi-joint assistance respectively, which is equivalent to an average metabolic reduction of 4.6% and 14.6% demonstrating that soft exosuits can effectively improve human walking efficiency during load carriage without affecting natural walking gait. Moreover, it indicates that actuating multiple joints with soft exosuits provides a significant benefit to muscular activity and metabolic cost compared to actuating single joint.

Aiming to reduce the energy cost of knee moment during stair ascent, this paper presents a concept of brake-torque support activated when the knee moment is required in the opposite direction to the angular velocity of the knee joint. Integrating an electromagnetic brake to a crossing four-bar knee joint with a compact design, the passive knee exoskeleton enables the polycentric knee center of rotation covering the wide range of knee angle during stair ascent. For preliminary validation, the surface electromyography (EMG) of rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) were studied on a healthy male volunteer wearing the exoskeleton on his right leg.

Having high percentage of elderly population, many countries have become a full-fledged aged society. Because aging process leads to evident losses of the muscle mass and strength [1], several types of human motion assist system are required for elderly to support their daily activities covering a great variety of lifestyles. With the advance in physical human–robot interaction, exoskeletons–consisting of external structures covering human limbs and joints–could provide mechanical power directly to physically weaken users such as elderly, disabled and injured people. Enabling a human to perceive a good quality life, walking ability is one of the most important fundamental function.

Compared with the popular deep learning structures, such as deep neural networks, BLS has the ability of rapid incremental learning and can remodel the system without the usual tedious retraining process. However, given that BLS is still in its infancy, it still needs analysis, improvements, and veriﬁcation. In this article, we ﬁrst analyze the principle of fast incremental learning ability of BLS in depth. Second, in order to provide an in-depth analysis of the BLS structure, according to the novel structure design concept of deep neural networks, we present four brand-new BLS variant networks and their incremental realizations. Third, based on our analysis of the effect of feature nodes and enhancement nodes, a new BLS structure with a semantic feature extraction layer has been proposed, which is called SFEBLS. The experimental results show that SFEBLS and its variants can increase the accuracy rate on the NORB dataset 6.18%, Fashion-MNIST dataset by 3.15%, ORL data by 5.00%, street view house number dataset by 12.88%, and CIFAR-10 dataset by 18.42%, respectively, and the four brand-new BLS variant networks also obviously outperform the original BLS.

First published July 9, 2015; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.01133.2014.—Techniques proposed for as- sisting locomotion with exoskeletons have often included a combina- tion of active work input and passive torque support, but the physio- logical effects of different assistance techniques remain unclear. We performed an experiment to study the independent effects of net exoskeleton work and average exoskeleton torque on human locomo- tion. Subjects wore a unilateral ankle exoskeleton and walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m·s1 while net exoskeleton work rate was system- atically varied from 0.054 to 0.25 J·kg1·s1, with constant (0.12 N·m·kg1) average exoskeleton torque, and while average exoskele- ton torque was systematically varied from approximately zero to 0.18 N·m·kg1, with approximately zero net exoskeleton work. We mea- sured metabolic rate, center-of-mass mechanics, joint mechanics, and muscle activity. Both techniques reduced effort-related measures at the assisted ankle, but this form of work input reduced metabolic cost (17% with maximum net work input) while this form of torque support increased metabolic cost (13% with maximum average torque). Disparate effects on metabolic rate seem to be due to cascading effects on whole body coordination, particularly related to assisted ankle muscle dynamics and the effects of trailing ankle behavior on leading leg mechanics during double support. It would be difﬁcult to predict these results using simple walking models without muscles or musculoskeletal models that assume ﬁxed kinematics or kinetics. Data from this experiment can be used to improve predictive models of human neuromuscular adaptation and guide the design of assistive devices.  biomechanics; locomotion; ankle foot orthosis; gait; rehabilitation","id":"c2b2138a-3f3a-4c36-a7aa-b206f25da5d6"}

Bennett, StudentMember,IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb, Member,IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes a control method intended to facilitate improved control of a myoelectric prosthesis containing a wrist rotator. Rather than exclu- sively utilizing electromyogram (EMG) for the control of all myoelectric components (e.g., a hand and a wrist), the proposed controller utilizes inertial measurement (from six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU)) to sense upper arm abduction\/adduction, and uses this input to command a wrist rotation velocity. As such, the controller essen- tially substitutes shoulder abduction\/adduction in place of agonist\/antagonist EMG to control wrist angular velocity, which preserves EMG for control of the hand (or other arm components). As a preliminary assessment of efﬁcacy, the control method was implemented on a transradial prosthe- sis prototype with a powered wrist rotator and hand, and experimentally assessed on ﬁve able-bodied subjects who wore the prototype using an able-bodied adaptor and one transradial amputee subject while performing assessments representative of activities of daily living. The assessments compared the (timed) performance of the combined EMG\/ IMU-based control method with a (conventional) sequential EMG control approach. Results of the assessment indicate that the able-bodiedsubjectswere able to perform the tasks 33% faster on average with the EMG\/IMU-based method, relativetoaconventionalsequentialEMGmethod.Thesame assessment was subsequently conducted using a single transradial amputee subject, which resulted in similar per- formance trends, although with a somewhat lessened effect size—speciﬁcally,the amputee subject was on average 22% faster in performing tasks with the IMU-based controller.","id":"964cfacc-746b-4053-9086-c892a47f4c8d"}

McLain3, Inseung Kang1, and Aaron J. Young1  Abstract— The knee joint performs a significant amount of positive or negative mechanical work during gradient walking, and targeted assistance during periods of high mechanical work could yield strong human augmentation benefits. This paper explores the biomechanical effects of providing knee extension assistance during the early stance phase of the gait cycle using a powered unilateral knee exoskeleton during gradient walking on able-bodied subjects. Twelve subjects walked on 15% gradient incline and decline surfaces with the exoskeleton providing knee extension assistance during the early stance phase of the gait cycle. For both incline and decline walking, the exoskeleton assistance reduced the muscle activation of the knee extensors on the assisted leg (p < 0.05). However, only approximately half the individuals responded to exoskeleton assistance positively by reducing their metabolic cost of walking for both incline and decline tasks. The results indicate that, unlike the individuals who did respond, the individuals who did not respond to the assistance may have penalized their metabolic cost by their biomechanical compensatory behaviors from the unassisted leg.

Additionally, the spring-like nature of DER prostheses does not allow for the substantial power dissipation following foot strike that characterizes non-amputee stair descent.  Recent advances in prosthetic technology have introduced powered ankle-foot prostheses, which are potentially capable of better replicating non-amputee human biomechanics than corresponding passive prostheses. Multiple powered transtibial prostheses have been introduced in research literature over the last decade, such as those described in [6]–[10].

INTRODUCTION  T HERE are between 40 000 and 100 000 individuals in the  U.S. with major upper extremity limb loss, roughly 40% of whom are transhumeral (above elbow) amputees [1], [2]. Transhumeral prostheses can aid individuals with transhumeral amputation to more capably perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Two major types of functional upper extremity pros- theses exist—the body-powered type and the myoelectric type. In the case of a transhumeral prosthesis, both types typically include an elbow joint and a terminal device (often either a split hook or a hand). The body-powered prosthesis type in- corporates Bowden cables, typically a pair, both attached to a shoulder harness worn by the user, such that the appropriate movement of the shoulder (e.g., shoulder ﬂexion and scapular abduction) will generate excursion of the respective cable. Al- though different variations exist, a common embodiment is the dual-control system, in which one cable (e.g., coupled to shoul- der ﬂexion) is used to provide movement of both the elbow and terminal device (i.e., cable excursion will simultaneously actu- ate both elbow ﬂexion and terminal device opening), while the other cable (e.g., coupled to scapular abduction) is used to lock or unlock the elbow [3]. Because opening the terminal device (against elastic bands) typically requires higher cable forces","id":"e54db071-4770-4b21-af71-ad927b4f8f4b"}

When defining requirements for any wearable robot for walking assistance, it is important to maximize the user’s metabolic benefit resulting from the exosuit assistance while limiting the metabolic penalty of carrying the system’s mass. Thus, the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the relationship between assistance magnitude and the metabolic cost of walking while also examining changes to the wearer’s underlying gait mechanics. The study was performed with a tethered multiarticular soft exosuit during normal walking, where assistance was di- rectly applied at the ankle joint and indirectly at the hip due to a textile architecture. The exosuit controller was designed such that the delivered torque profile at the ankle joint approximated that of the biological torque during normal walking. Seven participants walked on a treadmill at 1.5 meters per second under one unpowered and four powered conditions, where the peak moment applied at the ankle joint was varied from about 10 to 38% of biological ankle moment (equivalent to an applied force of 18.7 to 75.0% of body weight). Results showed that, with increasing exosuit assistance, net metabolic rate continually decreased within the tested range. When maximum assistance was applied, the metabolic rate of walking was reduced by 22.83 ± 3.17% relative to the powered-off condition (mean ± SEM).  INTRODUCTION Humans naturally walk in a manner that conserves energy; we opti- mize our cadence, step length, and arm swing to minimize metabolic energy consumption (1, 2). It is a commonly held belief that devia- tions from this normal walking pattern increase energy expenditure (3, 4). Certain diseases that affect gait, such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy, increase the net energy expenditure of walking by as much as 70% compared with healthy individuals (5–7). In addition, the energy expenditure of healthy individuals increases under strenuous activities, such as walking uphill or carrying heavy loads (8, 9). Such increases in metabolic consumption could lead to greater levels of fatigue and injury. For patient populations, the added effort could also decrease community involvement.","id":"22c71574-ad2f-4a42-bef8-dc3dad88234c"}

Ledet Ph.D. 1  Abstract— Osteoarthritis is one of the leading causes of chronic pain and disability in the United States. The gold standard to treat osteoarthritis of the knee is to perform a total knee replacement. Post-operatively, as high as 21% of total knee replacement patients experience moderate to severe anterior knee pain. The exact mechanism(s) of anterior knee pain remains unknown. Patellofemoral contact forces are believed to play a significant role in the mechanism of anterior knee pain. Yet, measuring contact forces in the patella has remained a challenge. We have developed a “smart patella” to measure force magnitudes and distributions across the patellofemoral joint. We have designed and conducted proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that our novel force sensing system has the potential to be implanted into the patellofemoral joint space with minimal alterations to modern implant design. Once implanted, our sensors measure in real time, in vivo patellofemoral contact forces.  component sizing, component alignment, ligament release, and passive flexion angle(s). Intuitively, patellar spacer thickness affects load transfer across the patellofemoral joint. In addition, non-optimal spacer size selection can lead to pathologic loading and cause anterior knee pain, but this remains controversial. Patellofemoral biomechanics have been modeled extensively, but due to the size, shape, and articulation of the joint, direct in vivo measurement of forces across the joint have been elusive. We have recently developed a novel implantable force sensor that can be used in conjunction with a standard TKA patellar component to measure forces in vivo, in real time across the patellofemoral joint. The purpose of this work was to develop and test a proof of concept smart patella system.  II. METHODS  A. Sensor Description  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"b9baecb5-7131-42bb-bb51-8daaa7148f64"}

Rouse1,2, and Talia Y. Moore1,2,3∗†‡  February 28, 2022  Abstract  Impressive animal locomotion capabilities are mediated by the co-evolution of the skeletal morphology and mus- cular properties. Legged robot performance would also likely beneﬁt from the co-optimization of actuators and leg morphology. However, development of custom actuators for legged robots is often expensive and time consuming, which discourages roboticists from pursuing performance gains aﬀorded by application-speciﬁc actuator optimization. This paper presents open-source designs for two quasi-direct-drive actuators with performance regimes appropriate for an 8–15 kg robot, built completely with oﬀ the shelf and 3D-printed components for less than $200 USD each. The mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of each actuator are characterized and compared to benchmark data. Actuators subjected to 420k strides of gait data experienced only a 2% reduction in eﬃciency and 26 mrad in backlash growth, demonstrating viability for rigorous and sustained research applications. We present a thermal solution that nearly doubles the thermally-driven torque limits of our plastic actuator design. The performance results are compa- rable to traditional metallic actuators for use in high-speed legged robots of the same scale. These 3D printed designs demonstrate an approach for designing and characterizing low-cost, highly customizable, and highly reproducible actuators, democratizing the ﬁeld of actuator design and enabling co-design and optimization of actuators and robot legs.  1 INTRODUCTION  Bioinspired legged robots have shown impressive agility, terrain traversal ability, and robustness [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, their performance capabilities are limited when compared to the diversity of terrestrial animals and their many forms of legged locomotion. The morphological features of robots also diﬀer greatly from their animal inspirations. The most popular mechanical designs have maximized simplicity and generality, typically featuring identical actuators and two-link legs across the robot [5].","id":"e148c63c-b3ba-4476-8623-6cf393e23f50"}

Collins1 ✉  Received: 23 February 2022  Accepted: 4 August 2022  Published online: 12 October 2022  Open access  Check for updates  Personalized exoskeleton assistance provides users with the largest improvements in walking speed1 and energy economy2–4 but requires lengthy tests under unnatural laboratory conditions. Here we show that exoskeleton optimization can be performed rapidly and under real-world conditions. We designed a portable ankle exoskeleton based on insights from tests with a versatile laboratory testbed. We developed a data-driven method for optimizing exoskeleton assistance outdoors using wearable sensors and found that it was equally effective as laboratory methods, but identified optimal parameters four times faster. We performed real-world optimization using data collected during many short bouts of walking at varying speeds. Assistance optimized during one hour of naturalistic walking in a public setting increased self-selected speed by 9 ± 4% and reduced the energy used to travel a given distance by 17 ± 5% compared with normal shoes. This assistance reduced metabolic energy consumption by 23 ± 8% when participants walked on a treadmill at a standard speed of 1.5 m s−1. Human movements encode information that can be used to personalize assistive devices and enhance performance.  Exoskeletons that assist leg movement show promise for enhancing personal mobility but have yet to provide real-world benefits. Millions of people have mobility impairments that make walking slower5 and more fatiguing6, while millions more people have occupations that require strenuous locomotion7. In research laboratories, exoskele- tons can increase walking speed1,8,9 and reduce the energy required to walk2–4,10–16, but these benefits have not yet translated to real-world conditions17. Providing beneficial assistance in the real world is difficult for several reasons: the specialized equipment used to personalize assistance is not available outside the laboratory; unlike walking on a treadmill, everyday walking occurs in many bouts of varying speed and duration; and devices must be self-contained and easy to use. In this study, we addressed each of these challenges to demonstrate effective exoskeleton assistance under naturalistic conditions.","id":"9716b96f-b630-4671-8d08-543a97fc4e83"}

Mechanical Engineering The University of Texas at Dallas Richardson, Texas 75080 Email: rgregg@utdallas.edu  ABSTRACT  Having uniﬁed representations of human walking gait data is of paramount importance for wearable robot control. In the rehabilitation robotics literature, control approaches that unify the gait cycle of wearable robots are more appealing than the conventional approaches that rely on dividing the gait cycle into several periods, each with their own distinct controllers. In this article we propose employing algebraic curves to represent hu- man walking data for wearable robot controller design. In or- der to generate algebraic curves from human walking data, we employ the 3L ﬁtting algorithm, a tool developed in the pattern recognition literature for ﬁtting implicit polynomial curves to gi- ven datasets. For an impedance model of the knee joint motion driven by the hip angle signal, we provide conditions by which the generated algebraic curves satisfy a robust relative degree condition throughout the entire walking gait cycle. The robust re- lative degree property makes the algebraic curve representation of walking gaits amenable to various nonlinear output tracking controller design techniques.  non-uniﬁed representations of walking gait result in dozens of control parameters and transition rules that must be tuned across users and activities [13]. Furthermore, desynchronizing pertur- bations increase a patient’s risk of falling if the controller swit- ches to the wrong state and as a result uses the wrong control scheme.","id":"e9bba3a7-dd04-4127-97bd-7631776469e8"}

Embry, Student Member, IEEE, Dario J. Villarreal, Member, IEEE, Rebecca L. Macaluso, and Robert D. Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Powered knee and ankle prostheses can perform a limited number of discrete ambulation tasks. This is largely due to their control architecture, which uses a ﬁnite-state machine to select among a set of task-speciﬁc controllers. A non-switching controller that supports a continuum of tasks is expected to better facilitate normative biomechanics. This paper introduces a predictive model that represents gait kinematics as a contin- uous function of gait cycle percentage, speed, and incline. The basis model consists of two parts: basis functions that produce kinematic trajectories over the gait cycle, and task functions that smoothly alter the weight of basis functions in response to task. Kinematic data from ten able-bodied subjects walking at twenty-seven combinations of speed and incline generate training and validation data for this data-driven model. Convex optimization accurately ﬁts the model to experimental data. Automated model order reduction improves predictive abilities by capturing only the most important kinematic changes due to walking tasks. Constraints on range of motion and jerk ensure the safety and comfort of the user. This model produces a smooth continuum of trajectories over task, an impossibility for ﬁnite-state control algorithms. Random sub-sampling validation indicates basis modeling predicts untrained kinematics more accurately than linear interpolation.  and minimizing back muscle activation related to the risk of low back pain [1].","id":"4815969f-cf6f-4fb1-8a20-e44477c225e5"}

The primary novel aspect of the controller is that it employs a virtual flow field to influence movement during swing, rather than a more typical potential-energy-based field. The controller was tested on a single stroke subject. The stroke subject’s leg kinematics demonstrate that the controller is capable of appropriately influencing leg kinematics during overground walking. I. INTRODUCTION ach year, about 665,000 people survive a stroke in the United States. Studies indicate that six months after the stroke, about 50% of these individuals had some form of lower extremity hemiparesis, and 30% were unable to walk without assistance [1], [2]. The resulting loss of mobility has detrimental effects on people’s physical and mental health and quality of life. Conventional post-stroke gait therapy includes overground gait training, in which one or more physical therapists (PTs) manually guides a patient’s movement while walking [3]. Lower limb exoskeletons may offer an assistive tool to PTs to aid in overground gait therapy. In this scenario, the exoskeleton can guide the patient’s legs through a desired motion, while a single PT can provide balance assistance (e.g., with a gait belt). In order to provide appropriate functionality in this regard, an exoskeleton should ideally offer movement guidance and assistance without interfering with a patient’s ability to correct for walking balance. Since two important factors in balance correction during walking are selection of step time and step length, an exoskeleton controller for these purposes should ideally allow patient-controlled variability in step length and step time [4], [5]. Some prior work has described controllers that influence walking motion, while allowing a patient to control step length or step time [6]–[10]. These controllers can loosely be grouped into two categories: 1) oscillator-based approaches [6], [7] and 2) potential-energy-based path approaches [8]–[10]. Both have been shown to be effective for overground exoskeleton-assisted walking. However, both have limitations. Specifically, since oscillator-based approaches do not employ a reference path, they are limited in their ability to influence inter-joint coordination during walking. Path-based approaches can influence inter-joint coordination, and are constructed of potential-energy-based fields","id":"800871d9-2552-4b96-9844-9da5491e2579"}

Atkeson2  Abstract—Learning controllers for bipedal robots is a chal- lenging problem, often requiring expert knowledge and exten- sive tuning of parameters that vary in different situations. Recently, deep reinforcement learning has shown promise at automatically learning controllers for complex systems in simulation. This has been followed by a push towards learning controllers that can be transferred between simulation and hardware, primarily with the use of domain randomization. However, domain randomization can make the problem of ﬁnding stable controllers even more challenging, especially for underactuated bipedal robots. In this work, we explore whether policies learned in simulation can be transferred to hardware with the use of high-ﬁdelity simulators and structured controllers. We learn a neural network policy which is a part of a more structured controller. While the neural network is learned in simulation, the rest of the controller stays ﬁxed, and can be tuned by the expert as needed. We show that using this approach can greatly speed up the rate of learning in simulation, as well as enable transfer of policies between simulation and hardware. We present our results on an ATRIAS robot and explore the effect of action spaces and cost functions on the rate of transfer between simulation and hardware. Our results show that structured policies can indeed be learned in simulation and implemented on hardware successfully. This has several advantages, as the structure preserves the intuitive nature of the policy, and the neural network improves the performance of the hand-designed policy. In this way, we propose a way of using neural networks to improve expert designed controllers, while maintaining ease of understanding.

Farris: ryan.farris@vanderbilt.edu; Michael Goldfarb: michael.goldfarb@vanderbilt.edu  Abstract  This paper describes a powered lower-limb orthosis that is intended to provide gait assistance to spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals by providing assistive torques at both hip and knee joints, along with a user interface and control structure that enables control of the powered orthosis via upper-body influence. The orthosis and control structure was experimentally implemented on a paraplegic subject (T10 complete) in order to provide a preliminary characterization of its capability to provide basic walking. Data and video is presented from these initial trials, which indicates that the orthosis and controller are able to effectively provide walking within parallel bars at an average speed of 0.8 km\/hr.  Index Terms  lower limb exoskeleton; assistive technology; powered orthosis; SCI; paraplegia  I. Introduction  THERE are currently about 262,000 spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals in the United States, with roughly 12,000 new injuries sustained each year at an average age of injury of 40.2 years [1]. Of these, at least 44% (at least 5300 cases per year) result in paraplegia. One of the most significant impairments resulting from paraplegia is the loss of mobility, particularly given the relatively young (average) age at which such injuries occur. Surveys of persons with paraplegia indicate that mobility concerns are among the most prevalent [2], and that chief among mobility desires is the ability to walk and stand [3]. In addition to impaired mobility, the inability to stand and walk entails severe physiological effects, including muscular atrophy, loss of bone mineral content, frequent skin breakdown problems, increased incidence of urinary tract infection, muscle spasticity, impaired lymphatic and vascular circulation, impaired digestive operation, and reduced respiratory and cardiovascular capacities [4].","id":"b7f6232d-0385-4cd8-bc80-d75ec62bd8fa"}

Real-time gait event detec- tion is executed with an inertial measurement unit based on an onboard trained model. Two models are trained based on the collected data from the knee exoskeleton at normal walk- ing speed under zero torque and assistive torque control modes, respectively. We conduct two experiments: 1) real-time detec- tion experiments under zero torque control at different speeds and 2) real-time detection and assistive torque control experi- ments based on real-time detection results at different speeds. Five able-bodied subjects participated in the experiments. The recognition accuracy and assistive torque performances based on real-time detection are evaluated. The experimental results show that all the critical gait events are detected rightly and the delay of gait event detection does not lead to damage to the overall system of knee exoskeleton. In addition, in real-time detection and assistive torque control experiments, parameters of the con- troller are refreshed for the current cycle based on the previous gait cycle, which is reasonable according to the detection result. The tracking performance of the torque could meet the require- ment. This paper provides a feasible and applicable method for knee exoskeleton control based on real-time gait event detection.

ACCEPTED JUNE, 2022 1 Abstract— The widespread adoption of powered lower-limb exoskeletons for augmenting mobility requires energy-efficient actuation to provide meaningful assistance over relevant walking durations. We designed, modeled, and validated an ankle exoskeleton design with a parallel elastic element in the form of a carbon fiber leaf spring that stored and returned energy in parallel to a cable-drive ankle joint during stance phase. We assessed the impact of the parallel elastic element on the performance of the untethered robotic ankle exoskeleton at walking speeds of 0.75-1.25 m\/s using a previously validated-controller, and a controller designed specifically to maximize the spring’s benefit. The spring selected for our adult cohort had a stiffness of 97.2 Nm\/rad, engaged best at 0-degrees ankle dorsiflexion, and produced 10-15 Nm peak assistive torque at all walking speeds. When tracking the previously validated exoskeleton controller, peak motor current was reduced by 14-20% and integrated current was reduced by 16-19% for parallel-elastic design vs. without spring engagement; this translated to 15-26% more assisted steps for the same battery capacity. When utilizing the controller designed to take advantage of the parallel spring torque, the number of assisted steps for the same battery capacity increased 46-76% compared to the no spring configuration depending on walking speed. Seeking to facilitate real-world adoption, this powered parallel elastic ankle exoskeleton design holds potential to significantly extend powered walking duration, and improve battery and motor life of operation by reducing peak and mean motor current requirements.

In this paper, we propose a multi-level real-time on-board system to recognize continu- ous locomotion modes. A cascaded classiﬁcation strategy is designed for the recognition of six steady locomotion modes and 10 transitions. On-board signals of the robotic prosthesis include two inertial measurement units and one load cell. Three transtibial amputees are recruited in the experiments. The prediction decision time of the real-time on-board cascaded classiﬁcation system is about 3.3 ms, which is enough short compared with the sliding window increment 10 ms. It is easy to recognize the standing and ambulation in the ﬁrst-level classiﬁcation with a 99.86% accuracy by quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classi- ﬁer. In the second-level classiﬁcation, threshold method is adopted to divide one stride into swing and stance phases. In swing phase, ﬁve steady modes are recognized with a total accuracy of 96.40%. In stance phase, all these ﬁve steady modes are recognized with a total accuracy of 91.21%. The average recognition accuracy of the three sub- jects is 93.21% by QDA classiﬁer.

During a ﬁnal assessment visit, metabolic cost, walking speed, and soleus electromyography were collected for baseline, unpowered, low, training-tuned, and high assistanceconditions. Compared to each participant’s baseline condition, we observed a 3.9 ± 1.9% (p = 0.050) increase in walking speed and a 22.0 ± 4.5% (p = 0.002) reduction in soleus activity with training-tuned assistance; metaboliccostoftransportwasunchanged(p=0.130).High assistance resulted in an 8.5 ± 4.0% (p = 0.042) reduction in metabolic cost of transport, a 6.3 ± 2.6% (p = 0.029) increase in walking speed, and a 25.0 ± 4.0% (p < 0.001) reduction in soleus activity.

While others have shown positive results, the fundamental question of how the exoskeleton interacts with the human remains unknown. Understanding the optimal as- sistance magnitude is not simply relevant for control, it is a critical knowledge for exoskeleton designers. An accurate understanding of assistance levels will enable the designers to minimize exoskele- ton mass and improve the performance by avoiding excessive ac- tuators and drivetrains. We explored the relationship between the assistance magnitude and the energetic cost beneﬁts by using a series elastic actuator driven powered hip exoskeleton. The ex- oskeleton controller mimics a human biological hip moment to provide the assistance during the gait cycle. Ten able-bodied subjects walked using the exoskeleton with different magnitudes of assistance in both hip ﬂexion and extension. Generally, the result- ing metabolic cost across different assistance conditions showed a U-shape trend which was consistent across all subjects (p < 0.01). The interpreted optimal assistance point through the quadratic ﬁt resulted in a 6% metabolic cost reduction with respect to the no- assistance condition. The study validated that simply increasing the assistance level did not yield higher energetic return.

Powell, Aaron J. Young, Member, IEEE, and Gregory S. Sawicki, Member, IEEE  Abstract—Objective: Semi-active combining lightweight, low powered actuators and passive-elastic elements are a promising approach to portable robotic assistance during locomotion. Here, we introduce a novel semi-active hip exoskeleton concept and evaluate human walking performance across a range of parameters using a tethered robotic testbed. Methods: We emulated semi-active hip exoskeleton (exo) assistance by applying a virtual torsional spring with a fixed rotational stiffness and an equilibrium angle established in terminal swing phase (i.e., via pre- tension into stance). We performed a 2-D sweep of spring stiffness x equilibrium position parameters (30 combinations) across walking speed (1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m\/s) and measured metabolic rate to identify device parameters for optimal metabolic benefit. Results: At each speed, optimal exoskeleton spring settings provided a ~10% metabolic benefit compared to zero-impedance (ZI). Higher walking speeds required higher exoskeleton stiffness and lower equilibrium angle for maximal metabolic benefit. Optimal parameters tuned to each individual (user-dependent) provided significantly larger metabolic benefit than the average- best settings (user-independent) at all speeds except the fastest (p = 0.021, p = 0.001, and p = 0.098 at 1.0, 1.3, and 1.6 m\/s, respectively). We found significant correlation between changes in user’s muscle activity and changes in metabolic rate due to exoskeleton assistance, especially for muscles crossing the hip joint. Conclusion: A semi-active hip exoskeleton with spring- parameters personalized to each user could provide metabolic benefit across functional walking speeds. Minimizing muscle activity local to the exoskeleton is a promising approach for tuning assistance on-line on a user-dependent basis.  exoskeletons  Index Terms—Exoskeleton, Hip, Muscle Electromyography, Impedance Control, Metabolic Cost, Walking Speed  I.

When we’re young, we often role-play and pretend we have superpowers. Inspired by these experiences, we started working on what we refer to as superhuman sports, focusing on how we might make some of these powers a reality.  We want to create an application area to explore human augmenta- tion and enhance human abilities in a playful way. The field of superhu- man sports combines competition and physical elements from traditional sports with technology to overcome the somatic and spatial limitations of our human bodies. The field serves as a fascinating application area for human augmentation.  Toward SuPErhuman SPorTS Science—in particular, information technology—is already an integral part of today’s sports training and events. However, traditional sports emphasize the achievements of the individual. Sport federations and competitions struggle when it comes to knowing how to deal with the augmented human concept.  Consider, for example, Markus Rehm, an amputated long jumper with a  prosthetic right leg. He uses a blade-type leg prosthesis when competing. In 2014, he qualified for the European Champi- onships but wasn’t allowed to compete,1 because his prosthesis was viewed as a violation of the rules, even though it hasn’t been proven that the prosthesis gives him a natural advantage; other athletes with similar prostheses didn’t perform so well.2 This illustrates the current direction and challenges of allowing augmented humans to partici- pate in conventional sports.  In contrast, superhuman sports aim to create a field where people compete, overcoming technological—rather than solely human—limitations. The focus is on improving cognitive and physical functions of the human body, creating artificial senses and reflexes to partici- pate in sports competitions. We want to create and explore new experiences with these novel senses and reflexes by augmenting old sports and designing new ones, enhancing sports training, and sharing the experiences with both local and remote audience members.","id":"6b0e90c4-7728-4da2-ad11-8e5727e845a7"}

Leg exoskeleton reduces the meta- bolic cost of human hopping. J Appl Physiol 107: 670–678, 2009. First published May 7, 2009; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.91609.2008.— During bouncing gaits such as hopping and running, leg muscles generate force to enable elastic energy storage and return primarily from tendons and, thus, demand metabolic energy. In an effort to reduce metabolic demand, we designed two elastic leg exoskeletons that act in parallel with the wearer’s legs; one exoskeleton consisted of a multiple leaf (MLE) and the other of a single leaf (SLE) set of ﬁberglass springs. We hypothesized that hoppers, hopping on both legs, would adjust their leg stiffness while wearing an exoskeleton so that the combination of the hopper and exoskeleton would behave as a linear spring-mass system with the same total stiffness as during normal hopping. We also hypothesized that decreased leg force generation while wearing an exoskeleton would reduce the metabolic power required for hopping. Nine subjects hopped in place at 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 Hz with and without an exoskeleton while we measured ground reaction forces, exoskeletal compression, and metabolic rates. While wearing an exoskeleton, hoppers adjusted their leg stiffness to maintain linear spring-mass mechanics and a total stiffness similar to normal hopping. Without accounting for the added weight of each exoskeleton, wearing the MLE reduced net metabolic power by an average of 6% and wearing the SLE reduced net metabolic power by an average of 24% compared with hopping normally at frequencies between 2.0 and 2.6 Hz. Thus, when hoppers used external parallel springs, they likely decreased the mechanical work performed by the legs and substantially reduced metabolic demand compared with hopping without wearing an exoskeleton.","id":"9a23803c-b3f5-4a5b-8c56-0c986f36bf74"}

As a potential way to assist gaits, lower limb ex- oskeletons have been developed. To supply appropriate assistive torque, real-time accurate recognition of current gait mode is important. In this article, a hierarchical con- trol system was proposed to recognize locomotion modes in real time for a unilateral knee exoskeleton on different terrains with speciﬁc assistive control strategies. Support vector machine classiﬁer was used to recognize the lo- comotion mode based on two inertia measurement units. The corresponding assistive control strategy was designed according to the recognition result. Real-time recognition experiments under assistive torque control were conducted on ﬁve able-bodied subjects and one stroke patient, respec- tively. For the able-bodied subjects: ﬁrst, no signiﬁcance was found on the total recognition accuracies whichever the leading leg was for the ﬁve subjects (p = 0.057), which indicated the proposed method in this article was suitable whichever the leading leg was as far as the overall classi- ﬁcation accuracy was concerned. Second, transitions oc- curred in swing phase when the leading leg was the paretic leg and transitions occurred in stance phase when the lead- ing leg was the sound leg. No signiﬁcance was found on mean delay time for the ﬁve subjects (p = 0.785) whichever the leading leg was, which indicated that the proposed method in this article was suitable for these two leading legs as far as the mean delay time were concerned.

Back- support devices have been developed to mitigate these injuries by aiding workers during lifting tasks. However, existing devices often fall short in providing multidimensional force assistance for asymmetric lifting, an essential feature for practical workplace use. In addition, validation of device safety across the entire human spine has been lacking. This paper introduces the Bilateral Back Extensor Exosuit (BBEX), a robotic back- support device designed to address both functionality and safety concerns. The design of the BBEX draws inspiration from the anatomical characteristics of the human spine and back extensor muscles. Using a multi–degree- of- freedom architecture and serially connected linear actuators, the device’s components are strategically arranged to closely mimic the bio- mechanics of the human spine and back extensor muscles. To establish the efficacy and safety of the BBEX, a series of experiments with human participants was conducted. Eleven healthy male participants engaged in symmetric and asymmetric lifting tasks while wearing the BBEX. The results confirm the ability of the BBEX to provide effec- tive multidimensional force assistance. Moreover, comprehensive safety validation was achieved through analy- ses of muscle fatigue in the upper and the lower erector spinae muscles, as well as mechanical loading on spinal joints during both lifting scenarios. By seamlessly integrating functionality inspired by human biomechanics with a focus on safety, this study offers a promising solution to address the persistent challenge of preventing lumbar spine injuries in demanding work environments.","id":"2936ec0b-661d-4df7-845f-e0693e870c45"}

Working in awkward kneeling postures for prolonged time periods can lead to knee pain, injuries, and osteoarthritis. In this ar- ticle, we present lightweight, wearable sensing, and knee assistive devices for construction workers during kneel- ing and squatting tasks. Analysis of kneeling on level and sloped surfaces (0◦, 10◦, and 20◦) is performed for single- and double-leg kneeling tasks. Measurements from the in- tegrated inertial measurement units are used for real-time gait detection and lower limb pose estimation. Detected gait events and pose estimation are used to control the assis- tive knee joint torque provided by lightweight exoskeletons with powerful quasi-direct drive actuation. Human subject experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analysis and control design. The results show reduction in knee extension\/ﬂexion muscle activation (up to 39%) during stand-to-kneel and kneel-to-stand tasks. Knee-ground contact forces\/pressures are also reduced (up to 15%) under robotic assistance during single-leg kneel- ing.

In this study, we used shear wave tensiometers to characterize the modulation of Achilles tendon force with load carriage and exosuit assistance at the ankle. When walking (1.25 m\/s) unassisted on a treadmill with load carriage weights of 15 and 30% of body weight, peak Achilles tendon force increased by 11 and 23%, respectively. Ankle exosuit assistance significantly reduced peak Achilles tendon force relative to unassisted, although the magnitude of change was variable across participants. Peak Achilles tendon force was significantly correlated with peak ankle torque for unassisted walking across load carriage conditions. However, when ankle plantarflexor assistance was applied, the relationship between peak tendon force and peak biological ankle torque was no longer significant. An outdoor pilot study was conducted in which a wearable shear wave tensiometer was used to measure Achilles tendon wave speed and compare across an array of assistance loading profiles. Reductions in tendon loading varied depending on the profile, highlighting the importance of in vivo measurements of muscle and tendon forces when studying and optimizing exoskeletons and exosuits.","id":"17a2b728-6e01-4dd7-b938-f5ea82898148"}

Following stroke, altered gait biomechanics contribute to inefﬁcient walking. Aside from assisting the ankle, there is also potential in augmenting locomotion by actuating the hip. We describe a proof-of-concept wearable, soft, hip exosuit, that assists with paretic hip ﬂexion during late stance and swing phases. The exosuit allows for adjustment of force and timing parameters. Parameter tuning was guided by a physical therapist based on their observations during study sessions. In a sample of survivors of stroke, we demonstrated that the hip exosuit was able to deliver low, comfortable levels of hip ﬂexion assistive forces. When powered, the exosuit effectively increased thigh angle and angular velocity during paretic swing phase compared to unpowered con- dition. These preliminary ﬁndings highlight the feasibility for clinicians to use a hip exosuit to directly target deﬁcits in limb advancement in hemiparetic gait.  1 Introduction  Stroke gait is slow, asymmetric, and metabolically inefﬁcient [1]. Motor deﬁcits of hip ﬂexors and ankle plantarﬂexors are known to contribute to impairments in gait speed and symmetry [2]. While several soft, modular, robotic systems seek to target the paretic ankle [3], actuating the hip may also augment locomotion in stroke. This study that assists hip ﬂexion during presents a proof-of-concept of a wearable exosuit walking in chronic stroke survivors.

Integrating an electromagnetic brake to a crossing four-bar knee joint with a compact design, the passive knee exoskeleton enables the polycentric knee center of rotation covering the wide range of knee angle during stair ascent. For preliminary validation, the surface electromyography (EMG) of rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF) were studied on a healthy male volunteer wearing the exoskeleton on his right leg.

Having high percentage of elderly population, many countries have become a full-fledged aged society. Because aging process leads to evident losses of the muscle mass and strength [1], several types of human motion assist system are required for elderly to support their daily activities covering a great variety of lifestyles. With the advance in physical human–robot interaction, exoskeletons–consisting of external structures covering human limbs and joints–could provide mechanical power directly to physically weaken users such as elderly, disabled and injured people.

Characterizing Optimal Performance of a Passive Elastic Ankle Exoskeleton during Human Locomotion. (Under the direction of Gregory S. Sawicki).  Perhaps because humans are already so well-tuned for locomotion, no  autonomous, wearable device intended to assist walking or running has succeeded  in reducing metabolic energy consumption for healthy individuals during typical  walking conditions. The ankle provides the majority of positive mechanical work  during walking and much of this work is delivered via elastic recoil from the Achilles’  tendon, which may serve as an energy savings mechanism. My goal for Chapter 1  was to develop a portable ankle exoskeleton taking inspiration from the passive  elastic mechanisms at play in the human triceps surae-Achilles’ tendon complex  during walking.  The exoskeleton was designed to be as transparent to the user as possible  having minimal interference with gait kinematics and lightweight enough to minimize  the metabolic penalty of adding mass to the user. I designed the exoskeleton to  provide plantarflexion torque during stance, and not interfere with toe clearance  during swing. To do this I developed a lightweight custom composite frame and two  clutches that can engage and disengage a parallel spring based only on ankle  kinematic state. The primary system is purely passive containing no motors,  electronics or external power supply. A secondary clutch has an additional low  power, servomotor to control the timing of engagement of the clutch, which still  passively provides assistance but is more versatile and can handle dynamically  changing gait (e.g. increases in speed, asymmetry due to impairment).  To test the validity of our exoskeleton design I performed a variety of studies  of individuals walking in many conditions with and without the exoskeleton, on a split  belt instrumented treadmill. Kinetic, kinematic, electromyography, and oxygen  consumption and carbon dioxide expiration were recorded during all trials. Initial  testing of the exoskeleton in Chapter 1 suggests the utility of the clutch, to act in  series with the parallel spring. My results indicate the clutched exoskeleton design  addresses all three of our design criteria: (1) it does not hinder natural gait  kinematics, (2) it is lightweight enough so that added mass has minimal effect on net  metabolic energy consumption, and (3) it can produce significant plantarflexor torque  assistance during stance, but does not resist toe clearance during swing.","id":"94136b50-4dab-408b-ac63-60d566040788"}

In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to not only estimate but predict the joint moment in advance for multiple ambulation modes. By combining electromyography (EMG), inertial measurement units (IMU), and electro- goniometers, we enable the prediction of the joint moment only from wearable sensors. We performed a forward feature selection to determine the best feature sets for different anticipation times of the intended moment generated at the hip, knee, and ankle, encompassing level walking on a treadmill and ascent\/descent of stairs and ramps. We show that wearable sensors can predict the joint moment with an MAE of 0.06 ± 0.02 Nm\/kg for direct estimation and an MAE of 0.10 ± 0.04 Nm\/kg when predicting 150 ms in advance, corresponding to an MAE within 9.2% of the joint moment range. We found that the hip moment had a significantly lower error than the knee and ankle when anticipating the joint moment (Bonferroni test, p < 0.05). The accurate estimation of the joint moment could monitor user activity to reduce risk factors and inform the control of exoskeletons.  1. Introduction","id":"1acbbe62-532a-4dca-86d7-6251d6a4d1af"}

Gregg , Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—This article presents the design and validation of a backdrivable powered knee orthosis for partial assis- tance of lower-limb musculature, which aims to facilitate daily activities in individuals with musculoskeletal disor- ders. The actuator design is guided by design principles that prioritize backdrivability, output torque, and compact- ness. First, we show that increasing the motor diameter while reducing the gear ratio for a ﬁxed output torque ul- timately reduces the reﬂected inertia (and thus backdrive torque). We also identify a tradeoff with actuator torque density that can be addressed by improving the motor’s thermal environment, motivating our design of a custom brushless dc motor with encapsulated windings. Finally, by designing a 7:1 planetary gearset directly into the stator, the actuator has a high package factor that reduces size and weight. Benchtop tests verify that the custom actua- tor can produce at least 23.9-N · m peak torque and 12.78- N · m continuous torque, yet has less than 2.68-N · m back- drive torque during walking conditions. Able-bodied human subject experiments (N = 3) demonstrate reduced quadri- cep activation with bilateral orthosis assistance during lifting-lowering, sit-to-stand, and stair climbing. The mini- mal transmission also produces negligible acoustic noise.  I. INTRODUCTION  T RADITIONALLY, exoskeletons (i.e., powered orthoses)","id":"1ad7d414-5d1e-49ba-a295-25d34aa63b41"}

Yet, little is known about how the prosthesis mechanics\/control inﬂu- ence wearer-prosthesis’ gait performance, such as gait symmetry, stability, etc. This study aimed to investigate the inﬂuence of robotic transfemoral prosthesis mechanics on human wearers’ gait symmetry. The investigation was enabled by our previously designed reinforcement learning (RL) supplementary control, which simultaneously tuned 12 control parameters that deter- mined the prosthesis mechanics throughout a gait cycle. The RL control design facilitated safe explorations of prosthesis mechanics with the human in the loop. Subjects were recruited and walked with a robotic transfemoral prosthesis on a treadmill while the RL controller tuned the control parameters. Stance time symmetry, step length symmetry, and bilateral anteroposterior (AP) impulses were measured. The data analysis showed that changes in robotic knee mechanics led to movement variations in both lower limbs and therefore gait temporal-spatial symmetry measures. Consistent across all inter-limb AP impulse measurements explained gait symmetry: the stance time symmetry was signiﬁcantly correlated with the net inter-limb AP impulse, and the step length symmetry was signiﬁcantly correlated with braking and propulsive impulse symmetry. The results suggest that it is possible to personalize transfemoral prosthesis control for improved temporal-spatial gait symmetry. However, adjusting prosthesis mechanics alone was insufﬁcient to maximize the gait symmetry. Rather, achieving gait symmetry may require coordination between the wearer’s motor control of the intact limb and adaptive control of the prosthetic joints. The results also indicated that the RL-based prosthesis tuning system was a potential tool for studying wearer-prosthesis interactions.  the subjects,","id":"6d67bf45-433a-42fb-8a43-7009ebc45e11"}

So far, most neuromechanical simulation studies have focused on demonstrating the capability of a proposed control model these models with competing control hypotheses can generate human-like normal walking behaviors, a more in-depth evaluation is required. Here, we conduct the more in-depth evaluation on a spinal-reﬂex-based control model using ﬁve representative gait disturbances, ranging from electrical stimulation to mechanical perturbation at individual leg joints and at the whole body. The immediate changes in muscle activations of the model are compared to those of humans across different gait phases and disturbance magnitudes. Remarkably similar response trends for the majority of investigated muscles and experimental conditions reinforce the plausibility of the reﬂex circuits of the model. However, the model’s responses lack in amplitude for two experiments with whole body disturbances suggesting that in these cases the proposed reﬂex circuits need to be ampliﬁed by additional control structures such as location-speciﬁc cutaneous reﬂexes. A model that captures these selective ampliﬁcations would be able to explain both steady and reactive spinal control of human locomotion. Neuromechanical simulations that investigate hypothesized control models are complementary to gait experiments in better understanding the control of human locomotion.  in generating normal walking.

The authors have previously proposed a multi-joint control method called a ﬂow controller, which provides several desirable characteristics for such assistance.

The single degree of actuation ﬂow control method was implemented on a representative system, speciﬁcally a knee exoskeleton that coordinates assistance with ipsilateral thigh move- ment during walking. The ability of the controller and knee exoskeleton to appropriately inﬂuence knee movement was evaluated in level walking experiments on three subjects with unilateral lower-limb impairment. Results show the device and controller provide improvements in knee move- ment in all subjects. Subjective feedback from the subjects indicates a high level of comfort with the controller.

The parameter values are determined by performing dynamic optimizations that takes into account the human-exoskeleton interactive dynamics. To emulate the adaptation skill of as- sisted human gait, human-robot interactive dynamics should be considered during optimization procedures. Most previous studies have only considered the normal gait for healthy people [5] and also they have not considered the human- robot interaction [6].  I. INTRODUCTION  Pathological gait patterns are observed in patients or elderly with gait disorders. For example, steppage gait occurs as a result of trying to compensate for the weakened ankle dorsiﬂexion. This compensation strategy with excessively ﬂexed hip and knee joints is used to clear the foot from the ground. Staggering gait occurs in post-stroke patients due imbalance caused from paretic limb.  Because their gait patterns are clearly different from a normal gait pattern. When using a robotic exoskeleton to assist their walking, they need a personalized assist pat- tern that is customized speciﬁc to their walking pattern to minimize mismatched assistive forces. When adjusting the control parameters for the assist pattern, the use of brute force search should be minimal to save time and effort. Gait simulation based approach can be a good alternative to provide assistance strategy guidelines for different gait types.","id":"48cdb2d4-9429-4a1a-9cfd-9bb81c7c55a1"}

How to run 50% faster without external energy Amanda Sutrisno and David J. Braun*  Technological innovations may enable next-generation running shoes to provide unprecedented mobility. But how could a running shoe increase the speed of motion without providing external energy? We found that the top speed of running may be increased more than 50% using a catapult-like exoskeleton device, which does not provide external energy. Our finding uncovers the hidden potential of human performance augmentation via unpowered robotic exoskeletons. Our result may lead to a new-generation of augmentation devices developed for sports, rescue operations, and law enforcement, where humans could benefit from increased speed of motion.  INTRODUCTION The top speed of human running, 12.3 m\/s (1), is near half the top speed of cycling, 21.4 m\/s (2), despite both motions being human powered. The lower speed of running suggests that humans have untapped energy-supplying capability, which can be used in cycling but cannot be used for faster running. Cycling is faster than running partly because (i) the rolling motion of the wheels prevents collisional energy losses from stepping (3) but also because (ii) wheels can support the weight of the body in place of the legs (4, 5), while (iii) pedals enable the human to supply energy continuously in the air (5) instead of intermittently when the leg is on the ground (6). These three features enable the bicycle to double the top speed of running, despite supplying no external energy and adding weight to the human. The same features may lead to novel augmentation devices that could increase the running speed using untapped human power, without wheels or external energy.","id":"dcd5ff5f-1449-470e-8643-9bdfd08b5c51"}

The purpose of this article is to provide a new framework for human–robot interaction control of LLEs. First, we designed the generative adversar- ial network-based graph transformer (GANGT) for applica- tion under small sample surface electromyography (sEMG) dataset conditions. The adversarial learning is utilized to generate featured sEMG data, and graph structure-based temporal and spatial self-attention mechanisms are con- structed to capture the local and global features of the sEMG signal during a gait cycle. Second, we designed a robust following controller to control the tracking error of the predicted joint angles and proved its stability through the Lyapunov function. The controller is able to maintain the tracking error within a small bound in the case of un- modeled errors and external disturbances in the dynamical system of the exoskeleton. To validate the effectiveness of the control framework, we conducted a series of ex- periments with recruited subjects.

In this paper, we propose a multi-level real-time on-board system to recognize continu- ous locomotion modes. A cascaded classiﬁcation strategy is designed for the recognition of six steady locomotion modes and 10 transitions. On-board signals of the robotic prosthesis include two inertial measurement units and one load cell. Three transtibial amputees are recruited in the experiments. The prediction decision time of the real-time on-board cascaded classiﬁcation system is about 3.3 ms, which is enough short compared with the sliding window increment 10 ms. It is easy to recognize the standing and ambulation in the ﬁrst-level classiﬁcation with a 99.86% accuracy by quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) classi- ﬁer. In the second-level classiﬁcation, threshold method is adopted to divide one stride into swing and stance phases. In swing phase, ﬁve steady modes are recognized with a total accuracy of 96.40%. In stance phase, all these ﬁve steady modes are recognized with a total accuracy of 91.21%. The average recognition accuracy of the three sub- jects is 93.21% by QDA classiﬁer. Besides, for transitions, the proposed system could recognize all transitions rightly. The designed system is feasible and effective to realize real-time on-board recognition of continuous locomotion modes, which is promising for the further control of the prosthesis.

Speciﬁcally, the control strategy uses an extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF) that fuses angle and velocity measurements from the hip, knee, and ankle joints to estimate the phase and its rate of change. The control strategy then uses these estimates as inputs into Gaussian Process (GP) functions that specify the desired angles, velocities, and feed-forward torques for the knee and ankle joints. These control surfaces are designed to appropriately adapt to speed variations and transitions to standing. We compare this proposed GP-EKF control strategy to both a neuromuscular control (NM) strategy and an impedance control (IMP) strategy in experiments with able-bodied subjects and an amputee subject. We ﬁnd that GP-EKF control generates sig- niﬁcantly more natural knee behavior but slightly less natural ankle behavior than both NM or IMP control. In addition, we ﬁnd in experiments with the subjects stepping on blocks during stance that the GP-EKF control resulted in signiﬁcantly fewer falls than IMP control. Finally, we evaluate the ability of the proposed control to track phase across varying treadmill speeds including sudden stops, and ﬁnd that the EKF’s phase estimate tracks these gait changes signiﬁcantly better than a time-based phase estimate. The proposed control strategy may provide a robust and adaptive control alternative for powered transfemoral prostheses.  relies on the detection of gait events, such as joint angles crossing thresholds, to trigger phase transitions that may cause abrupt changes in torque output as well as unreliable responses to gait disturbances.","id":"7d6b6999-dd15-43fb-a370-e93e99aa4294"}

A major contributor to walking deficits is impaired paretic ankle function. Impaired paretic ankle plantarflexion (PF) reduces forward propulsion symmetry and impaired paretic ankle dorsiflexion (DF) diminishes ground clearance during swing. We have developed soft wearable robots (soft exosuits) to assist paretic PF and DF during walking after stroke. Through experimental studies with poststroke patients, we have demonstrated that exosuits can improve forward propulsion symmetry and ground clearance in walking, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of walking. This paper presents an optimized soft exosuit aimed at use in clinical gait training for patients poststroke. The optimized exosuit is lightweight, easy to don and doff, and capable of efficiently delivering mechanical assistance to the paretic ankle. This paper focuses on the optimized controller that can deliver well-timed consistent ankle assistance to patients. A preliminary study was performed using this exosuit with three poststroke patients with heterogeneous gait patterns. Results showed that compared to a previously published controller, more consistent assistive force profiles could be delivered to individuals poststroke while consuming 50% less electrical power. Additionally, a preliminary biomechanical assessment was performed during overground walking. I. INTRODUCTION Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability [1], with 80% of survivors having locomotor impairments [2]. Individuals after stroke typically present with hemiparetic gait, characterized as slow, asymmetric, and inefficient [3]–[5]. A major contributor to poststroke locomotion is impaired paretic ankle function, specifically during the push-off and swing phases of the gait cycle [5]–[9]. During push-off, diminished paretic ankle plantarflexion (PF) function inhibits the paretic limb’s contribution to forward propulsion [6]–[8]. During swing, diminished paretic ankle dorsiflexion (DF) function leads to poor foot clearance [8], increasing the risk of tripping and falling [10]. Our laboratory has developed soft wearable robots, called soft exosuits, that deliver mechanical power to the lower-limb joints via the interaction of Bowden cables driven by actuators and functional apparel components [11]–[17]","id":"aa4480d7-055e-4dfb-bd98-64d1cb1a0d17"}

In the rehabilitation robotics literature, control approaches that unify the gait cycle of wearable robots are more appealing than the conventional approaches that rely on dividing the gait cycle into several periods, each with their own distinct controllers. In this article we propose employing algebraic curves to represent hu- man walking data for wearable robot controller design. In or- der to generate algebraic curves from human walking data, we employ the 3L ﬁtting algorithm, a tool developed in the pattern recognition literature for ﬁtting implicit polynomial curves to gi- ven datasets. For an impedance model of the knee joint motion driven by the hip angle signal, we provide conditions by which the generated algebraic curves satisfy a robust relative degree condition throughout the entire walking gait cycle. The robust re- lative degree property makes the algebraic curve representation of walking gaits amenable to various nonlinear output tracking controller design techniques.  non-uniﬁed representations of walking gait result in dozens of control parameters and transition rules that must be tuned across users and activities [13]. Furthermore, desynchronizing pertur- bations increase a patient’s risk of falling if the controller swit- ches to the wrong state and as a result uses the wrong control scheme.","id":"e9bba3a7-dd04-4127-97bd-7631776469e8"}

Rouse1,2*  User preference is a promising objective for the control of robotic exoskeletons because it may capture the multi- factorial nature of exoskeleton use. However, to use it, we must first understand its characteristics in the context of exoskeleton control. Here, we systematically measured the control preferences of individuals wearing bilateral ankle exoskeletons during walking. We investigated users’ repeatability identifying their preferences and how preference changes with walking speed, device exposure, and between individuals with different technical back- grounds. Twelve naive and 12 knowledgeable nondisabled participants identified their preferred assistance in repeated trials by simultaneously self-tuning the magnitude and timing of peak torque. They were blinded to the control parameters and relied solely on their perception of the assistance to guide their tuning. We found that participants’ preferences ranged from 7.9 to 19.4 newton-meters and 54.1 to 59.2 percent of the gait cycle. Across trials, participants repeatably identified their preferences with a mean standard deviation of 1.7 newton-meters and 1.5 percent of the gait cycle. Within a trial, participants converged on their preference in 105 seconds. As the experiment progressed, naive users preferred higher torque magnitude. At faster walking speeds, these individuals were more precise at identifying the magnitude of their preferred assistance. Knowledgeable users preferred higher torque than naive users. These results highlight that although preference is a dynamic quantity, individuals can reliably identify their preferences. This work motivates strategies for the control of lower limb exoskeletons in which individuals customize assistance according to their unique preferences and provides meaningful insight into how users interact with exoskeletons.","id":"2ffb475d-4769-4e52-b545-50d6ae6b05b2"}

There has been an increasing de- mand for robot agents to assist in these dynamic, rapid mo- tions that are constantly evolving and require quick, accu- rate estimation of a user’s direction of travel. An experiment was conducted in a motion capture space with six subjects performing threat-evasion in 8 directions, and their mechan- ical and neuromuscular signals were recorded for use in our intent recognition system (XGBoost). Investigated against current, analytical methods, our system demonstrated supe- rior performance with quicker direction of travel estimation occurring 140 ms earlier in the movement and a 11.6◦ reduc- tion of error. The results showed that we could even predict movement start 100 ms prior to the actual, thus allowing any physical systems to start up. Our direction estimation had an optimal performance of 8.8◦, or 2.4% of the 360◦ range of travel, using 3-axis kinetic data. The performance of other sensors and their combinations indicate that there are ad- ditional possibilities to obtain low estimation error. These ﬁndings are promising as they can be used to inform the de- sign of a wearable robot aimed at assisting users in dynamic motions, while in environments with oncoming threats.","id":"4518f42c-ad1f-47c3-80d6-7d265ead44f7"}

Nguyen1, Rachel W. Jackson2, Yashar Aucie3, Digna de Kam3, Steven H. Collins1 and Gelsy Torres-Oviedo3*  Abstract  Background: Asymmetric gait post-stroke is associated with decreased mobility, yet individuals with chronic stroke often self-select an asymmetric gait despite being capable of walking more symmetrically. The purpose of this study was to test whether self-selected asymmetry could be explained by energy cost minimization. We hypothesized that short-term deviations from self-selected asymmetry would result in increased metabolic energy consumption, despite being associated with long-term rehabilitation benefits. Other studies have found no difference in metabolic rate across different levels of enforced asymmetry among individuals with chronic stroke, but used methods that left some uncertainty to be resolved.  Methods: In this study, ten individuals with chronic stroke walked on a treadmill at participant-specific speeds while voluntarily altering step length asymmetry. We included only participants with clinically relevant self-selected asymmetry who were able to significantly alter asymmetry using visual biofeedback. Conditions included targeting zero asymmetry, self-selected asymmetry, and double the self-selected asymmetry. Participants were trained with the biofeedback system in one session, and data were collected in three subsequent sessions with repeated measures. Self-selected asymmetry was consistent across sessions. A similar protocol was conducted among unimpaired participants. Results: Participants with chronic stroke substantially altered step length asymmetry using biofeedback, but this did not affect metabolic rate (ANOVA, p = 0.68). In unimpaired participants, self-selected step length asymmetry was close to zero and corresponded to the lowest metabolic energy cost (ANOVA, p = 6e-4). While the symmetry of unimpaired gait may be the result of energy cost minimization, self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke cannot be explained by a similar least-effort drive.  Conclusions: Interventions that encourage changes in step length asymmetry by manipulating metabolic energy consumption may be effective because these therapies would not have to overcome a metabolic penalty for altering asymmetry.","id":"8736cf6b-b599-4ab7-8618-f7bb3def1f90"}

In this paper, the performance of a piezoelectric energy harvester embedded within custom-designed knee implant in powering RF transmitter was evaluated through simulations. This power harvester is composed of four piezoelectric generators along with four off-the-shelf power conditioning circuits. It can har- vest electric power from dynamic forces dissipated inside knee implant during walking. The results demonstrate the possibility to deliver a constant electric power of 59.4mW during a simu- lated walking cycle. This conditioned power can operate an off- the-shelf ultra-low power RF transmitter. This may eliminate the need for rechargeable batteries to power instrumented knee implants. The proposed piezoelectric generator along with the ultra-miniature power conditioning and telemetry circuits may be integrated within the knee implant without increasing its physical size or changing its geometrical shape signiﬁcantly with respect to the conventional one. Therefore, its dynamic functionality and mechanical longevity may not be affected.  I. INTRODUCTION  or surgical preventive actions may be considered before damaging the implant to an extent where revision surgery is unavoidable. The preventive actions may include changes in patient’s lifestyle to avoid overloading the implant during weight-bearing athletic activities, physical therapy or even non-invasive or minimally-invasive surgical intervention. The need for revision surgery in order to replace damaged knee implants may then be reduced.  The telemetric system embedded into instrumented im- plants needs electric power to function during the in-vivo monitoring of tibiofemoral force distribution. This system can be powered by either externally via inductive coupling [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] or internally through an integrated power harvesting system. For the externally-powered sys- tems, the power transfer efﬁciency depends on the coil parameters, geometries and alignments in addition to the mutual distance between the external coil located outside the body (transmitter) and the internal coil integrated into the knee implant (receiver) [11].","id":"2f65749c-7ef4-4196-8fb4-69bd06e791ca"}

We have developed soft wearable robots (soft exosuits) to assist paretic PF and DF during walking after stroke. Through experimental studies with poststroke patients, we have demonstrated that exosuits can improve forward propulsion symmetry and ground clearance in walking, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of walking. This paper presents an optimized soft exosuit aimed at use in clinical gait training for patients poststroke. The optimized exosuit is lightweight, easy to don and doff, and capable of efficiently delivering mechanical assistance to the paretic ankle. This paper focuses on the optimized controller that can deliver well-timed consistent ankle assistance to patients. A preliminary study was performed using this exosuit with three poststroke patients with heterogeneous gait patterns. Results showed that compared to a previously published controller, more consistent assistive force profiles could be delivered to individuals poststroke while consuming 50% less electrical power. Additionally, a preliminary biomechanical assessment was performed during overground walking. I. INTRODUCTION Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability [1], with 80% of survivors having locomotor impairments [2]. Individuals after stroke typically present with hemiparetic gait, characterized as slow, asymmetric, and inefficient [3]–[5]. A major contributor to poststroke locomotion is impaired paretic ankle function, specifically during the push-off and swing phases of the gait cycle [5]–[9]. During push-off, diminished paretic ankle plantarflexion (PF) function inhibits the paretic limb’s contribution to forward propulsion [6]–[8]. During swing, diminished paretic ankle dorsiflexion (DF) function leads to poor foot clearance [8], increasing the risk of tripping and falling [10]. Our laboratory has developed soft wearable robots, called soft exosuits, that deliver mechanical power to the lower-limb joints via the interaction of Bowden cables driven by actuators and functional apparel components [11]–[17]","id":"aa4480d7-055e-4dfb-bd98-64d1cb1a0d17"}

The effort to perform a squat can decrease using an exoskeleton that considers individual worker’s differences and assists them with a customized solution, namely, personalized assistance. Designing such an exoskeleton could be improved by understanding how the user’s muscle activity changes when assistance is provided. This study investigated the change in the muscle recruitment and activation pattern when personalized assistance was provided. The personalized assistance was provided by an ankle–foot exoskeleton during squatting and we compared its effect with that of the no-device and unpowered exoskeleton conditions using previously collected data. We identified four main muscle recruitment strategies across ten participants. One of the strategies mainly used quadriceps muscles, and the activation level corresponding to the strategy was reduced under exoskeleton assistance compared to the no-device and unpowered conditions. These quadriceps dominant synergy and rectus femoris activations showed reasonable correlations (r = 0.65, 0.59) to the metabolic cost of squatting. These results indicate that the assistance helped reduce quadriceps activation, and thus, the metabolic cost of squatting. These outcomes suggest that the muscle recruitment and activation patterns could be used to design an exoskeleton and training methods.","id":"412fc10b-32bb-4e3a-b7bb-dd726ae3ffc2"}

Direct comparison studies are needed to determine how users respond to different types of control. The purpose of this study was to compare user performance using a robotic hip exoskeleton with two different controllers: a controller that targeted a biological hip torque profile and a proportional myoelectric controller.  Edited by: Jan Veneman, Tecnalia, Spain  Reviewed by: Laurent Simon, New Jersey Institute of Technology, United States Fausto Antonio Panizzolo, Harvard University, United States  Methods: We tested both control approaches on 10 able-bodied subjects using a pneu- matically powered hip exoskeleton. The state machine controller targeted a biological hip torque profile. The myoelectric controller used electromyography (EMG) of lower limb muscles to produce a proportional control signal for the hip exoskeleton. Each subject performed two 30-min exoskeleton walking trials (1.0 m\/s) using each controller and a 10-min trial with the exoskeleton unpowered. During each trial, we measured subjects’ metabolic cost of walking, lower limb EMG profiles, and joint kinematics and kinetics (torques and powers) using a force treadmill and motion capture.

Ten normal subjects ascended and descended a ﬁve-step staircase at three different inclinations (24°, 30°, 42°). Three steps were instrumented with force sensors and provided 6 dof ground reactions. Kinematics was analysed by a camera-based optoelectronic system. An inverse dynamics approach was applied to compute joint moments and powers. The different kinematic and kinetic patterns of stair ascent and descent were analysed and compared to level walking patterns. Temporal gait cycle parameters and ground reactions were not signiﬁcantly affected by staircase inclination. Joint angles and moments showed a relatively low but signiﬁcant dependency on the inclination. A large inﬂuence was observed in joint powers. This can be related to the varying amount of potential energy that has to be produced (during ascent) or absorbed (during descent) by the muscles. The kinematics and kinetics of staircase walking differ considerably from level walking. Interestingly, no deﬁnite signs could be found indicating that there is an adaptation or shift in the motor patterns when moving from level to stair walking. This can be clearly seen in the foot placement: compared to level walking, the forefoot strikes the ground ﬁrst—independent from climbing direction and inclination. This and further ﬁndings suggest that there is a certain inclination angle or angular range where subjects do switch between a level walking and a stair walking gait pattern. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In addition to walking on ﬂat terrain, the y are evolving to handle advanced scenarios such as stairs, allowing for a wider range of activities.

Two kinds of numerical simulations and real exoskeleton experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively and safely generate the trajectories to as- sist users in ascending stairs.

Seeking to improve the effectiveness of gait train- ing in this patient population, this study developed and assessed the feasibility of a real-time biofeedback mech- anism to augment untethered ankle exoskeleton-assisted walking performance in individuals with CP. We selected step length as a clinically-relevant gait performance target and utilized a visual interface with live performance scores. An adaptive ankle exoskeleton control algorithm provided assistance proportional to the real-time ankle moment. We assessed lower-extremity gait mechanics and muscle activity in seven ambulatory individuals with CP as they walked with adaptive ankle assistance alone and with ankle assistance plus step-length biofeedback. We achieved our technical validation goal by demonstrating a strong corre- lation between estimated step length and real step length (R = 0.771, p < 0.001). We achieved our clinical feasibil- ity goal by demonstrating that biofeedback-plus-assistance resulted in a 14% increase in step length relative to baseline (p ≤ 0.05), while no difference in step length was observed for assistance alone. Additionally, we observed near imme- diate improvements in lower-extremity posture, moments, and positive power relative to baseline for biofeedback- plus-assistance (p < 0.05), with none, or more-limited improvements observed for assistance alone. Our ﬁndings suggestthatprovidingreal-timebiofeedbackandusingstep length as the target can be effective for increasing the rate at which individuals with CP improve their gait mechanics when walking with wearable ankle assistance.  I. INTRODUCTION  INDIVIDUALS with cerebral palsy (CP) experience move-  ment and posture impairment that negatively affects their mobility and physical activity levels [1], [2]. They often exhibit pathological gait patterns that can involve excessive knee and hip ﬂexion during stance and reduced ankle plantarﬂexion prior to push-off. These gait patterns are associated with slow walking speed, reduced step length and increased energy cost of transport [3]–[5]. Many children with CP experience a steady decline in mobility across their lifespan [6].","id":"a233c1c2-2627-44f8-a661-598c9ae35f8e"}

We introduced a new reinforcement learning (RL) controller for this purpose based on the promising ability of RL controllers to solve optimal control problems through interactions with the environment without requiring an explicit system model. However, collecting data from a human-prosthesis system is expensive and thus the design of a RL controller has to take into account data and time efﬁciency. We therefore propose an ofﬂine policy iteration based reinforcement learning approach. Our solution is built on the ﬁnite state machine (FSM) impedance control framework, which is the most used prosthesis control method in commercial and prototypic robotic prosthesis. Under such a framework, we designed an approximate policy iteration algorithm to devise impedance parameter update rules for 12 prosthesis control parameters in order to meet individual users’ needs. The goal of the reinforcement learning-based control was to reproduce near-normal knee kinematics during gait. We tested the RL controller obtained from ofﬂine learning in real time experiment involving the same able-bodied human subject wearing a robotic lower limb prosthesis. Our results showed that the RL control resulted in good convergent behavior in kinematic states, and the ofﬂine learning control policy successfully adjusted the prosthesis control parameters to produce near-normal knee kinematics in 10 updates of the impedance control parameters.","id":"dd7a0f3b-e6bf-401a-bc73-ae85eb2d67ba"}

Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 23% when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg.  Methods: We used human-in the-loop optimization to optimize hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance with no additional load, a light load (15% of body weight), and a heavy load (30% of body weight) for three participants. All loads were applied through a weight vest with an attached waist belt. We measured metabolic cost, exoskeleton assistance, kinematics, and muscle activity. We performed one-tailed paired t-tests to determine signiﬁcant reductions for metabolic cost and muscle activity, and we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine signiﬁcant changes across load conditions for metabolic cost and applied power.  Results: Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking relative to walking in the device without assistance for all tested conditions. Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 47% with no load (p = 0.02), 35% with the light load (p = 0.03), and 43% with the heavy load (p = 0.02). The smaller metabolic reduction with the light load may be due to insuﬃcient participant training or lack of optimizer convergence. The total applied positive power was similar for all tested conditions, and the positive knee power decreased slightly as load increased. Optimized torque timing parameters were consistent across participants and load conditions while optimized magnitude parameters varied.","id":"55c10e03-19a8-4b12-a219-de6a7027daf2"}

In order to it is crucial to guarantee achieve high performance robots, harmonious integration between software and hardware. Hence, the development of such capable robotic platforms must address design requirements that meet the assumptions of typical model- based controllers but also respect the physical limitations of a real system. First, we show that proper hardware design choices can greatly aid the control algorithm by approximating the physical robot to the template assumptions. We include actuation and sensing design examples that allows a simple model to capture a major portion of the natural dynamic behavior of the physical machine. Results are applied to a real robot (Figure 1) and we show that the adopted methodology is able to address typical problems in legged robots such as high bandwidth force control and robustness to impact. Finally, a simple model-based balance controller that takes advantage of the ﬁdelity of the template model to the real machine is implemented. These are examples of software-hardware co- design processes that vastly facilitate robotic control.  I. INTRODUCTION  To build legged machines capable of dynamic physical interactions with the environment remains as one of the great challenges in the robotics ﬁeld. These interactions consist of complex dynamic phenomena that involve the control algorithm, the hardware and the outside world. Hence, it is clear that the development of dynamic legged robots should tightly integrate the reasoning process of both software and hardware.

The three conﬁgurations were comparable for the evaluation of TD children and children with a low level of disability (CP-GMFCS I) whereas the shank-and-thigh-based conﬁguration was more robust regarding children with a higher level of disability (CP-GMFCS II–III).

The classification method was tested in experiments conducted with seven healthy subjects performing three different locomotor activities: level ground walking, stair descent, and stair ascent. Classification accuracy of the phase variable classification method was assessed for classifying each activity, and transitions between activities, and compared to a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier as a benchmark. Results: For the subjects tested, the phase variable classification method outperformed LDA when using non-subject- specific training data, while the LDA outperformed the phase variable approach when using training. Conclusions: The proposed method may provide improved classification accuracy for gait classification applications trained with non-subject-specific data. Significance: This paper offers a new method of gait classification based on a phase variable description. The method improved classification accuracy relative to an LDA pattern recognition framework when trained with non-subject-specific data.  subject-specific  is shown  to provide  Index Terms—Gait Recognition, Classification Algorithms,  Patient Monitoring, Legged Locomotion  I.

It has been shown that they are capable of attaining improved temporal and propulsive symmetry when walking with a powered knee prosthesis and visual feedback, but they perceive this pattern of gait to be more difficult. Rather than improving the efficiency of gait, improved gait symmetry may be increasing individuals’ effort associated with maintaining lateral balance. Methods: In this study, we used a simple visual feedback paradigm to increase the prosthesis-side stance time of six individuals with unilateral TFA or KD as they walked on a powered knee prosthesis at their self-selected speed. As they walked more symmetrically, we evaluated changes in medial-lateral center-of-mass excursion, lateral margin of stability, stride width, and hip abductor activity. Results: As the subjects increased their prosthesis-side stance time, their center-of-mass excursion and hip abductor activity significantly increased, while their lateral margin of stability significantly decreased on the prosthesis-side only. Stride width remained relatively unchanged with testing condition. Conclusions: Extended stance time on a powered knee prosthesis (yielding more symmetric gait) challenged the lateral balance of individuals with lower limb amputation. Lateral stability may be a reason they prefer an asymmetric gait, even with more advanced technology. Hip muscular changes post-amputation may contribute to the decline in stability on the prosthesis side. Interventions and advancements in prosthesis control aimed at improving their control of lateral balance may ameliorate the difficulty in walking with improved gait symmetry.

The effort to perform a squat can decrease using an exoskeleton that considers individual worker’s differences and assists them with a customized solution, namely, personalized assistance. Designing such an exoskeleton could be improved by understanding how the user’s muscle activity changes when assistance is provided. This study investigated the change in the muscle recruitment and activation pattern when personalized assistance was provided. The personalized assistance was provided by an ankle–foot exoskeleton during squatting and we compared its effect with that of the no-device and unpowered exoskeleton conditions using previously collected data. We identified four main muscle recruitment strategies across ten participants. One of the strategies mainly used quadriceps muscles, and the activation level corresponding to the strategy was reduced under exoskeleton assistance compared to the no-device and unpowered conditions. These quadriceps dominant synergy and rectus femoris activations showed reasonable correlations (r = 0.65, 0.59) to the metabolic cost of squatting. These results indicate that the assistance helped reduce quadriceps activation, and thus, the metabolic cost of squatting. These outcomes suggest that the muscle recruitment and activation patterns could be used to design an exoskeleton and training methods.","id":"412fc10b-32bb-4e3a-b7bb-dd726ae3ffc2"}

Modern control strategies for wearable robots are predicated on activity-speciﬁc implementations, and testing is usually limited to a single, ﬁxed activity within the laboratory (e.g., level ground walking). To accommodate various activities in real- world scenarios, control strategies mustinclude theability tosafely andseamlesslytransitionbetweenactivity-speciﬁccontrollers.One potential solution to this challenge is to the infer wearer’s intent using pattern recognition of locomotion sensor data. To this end, we developed an intent recognition framework implementing con- volutional neural networks with image encoding (i.e. spectrogram) that enables prediction of the upcoming locomotor activity of the wearer’s next step. In this letter, we describe our intent recog- nition system, comprised of a mel-spectrogram and subsequent neural network architecture. In addition, we analyzed the effect of sensor locations and modalities on the recognition system, and compared our proposed system to state-of-the-art locomotor intent recognition strategies.

Compared to previous exoskeletons, the device is ultra-lightweight, resulting in low mechanical impedance and inertia. The exosuit has custom McKibben style pneumatic actuators that can assist the hip, knee and ankle. The actuators attach to the exosuit through a network of soft, inextensible webbing triangulated to attachment points utilizing a novel approach we call the virtual anchor technique. This approach is designed to transfer forces to locations on the body that can best accept load. Pneumatic actuation was chosen for this initial prototype because the McKibben actuators are soft and can be easily driven by an off-board compressor. The exosuit itself (human interface and actuators) had a mass of 3500 g and with peripherals (excluding air supply) is 7144 g. In order to examine the exosuit’s performance, a pilot study with one subject was performed which investigated the effect of the ankle plantar-flexion timing on the wearer’s hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics and metabolic power when walking. Wearing the suit in a passive unpowered mode had little effect on hip, knee and ankle joint kinematics as compared to baseline walking when not wearing the suit. Engaging the actuators at the ankles at 30% of the gait cycle for 250 ms altered joint kinematics the least and also minimized metabolic power. The subject’s average metabolic power was 386.7 W, almost identical to the average power when wearing no suit (381.8 W), and substantially less than walking with the unpowered suit (430.6 W). This preliminary work demonstrates that the exosuit can comfortably transmit joint torques to the user while not restricting mobility and that with further optimization, has the potential to reduce the wearer’s metabolic cost during walking. I.

Body-weight supported training systems have been developed to help patients regain mobility and con- ﬁdence during walking, but conventional systems constrain the patient’s treatment in clinical environments. We propose that this challenge could be addressed by virtually providing patients with body-weight support through the actuators of a powered orthosis (or exoskeleton) utilizing potential energy-shaping con- trol. However, the changing contact conditions and the degrees of underactuation encountered during human walking present signiﬁcant challenges to consistently matching a desired potential energy for the human in closed loop. We therefore derive a generalized matching condition for shaping Lagrangian systems with holonomic contact constraints. By satisfying this matching condition for four phases of gait, we derive passivity-based control laws to achieve virtual body-weight support through a powered knee-ankle orthosis. We demonstrate the beneﬁcial effects of virtual body-weight support in simulations of a human-like biped model, indicating the potential clinical value of this proposed control approach.

Following stroke, altered gait biomechanics contribute to inefﬁcient walking. Aside from assisting the ankle, there is also potential in augmenting locomotion by actuating the hip. We describe a proof-of-concept wearable, soft, hip exosuit, that assists with paretic hip ﬂexion during late stance and swing phases. The exosuit allows for adjustment of force and timing parameters. Parameter tuning was guided by a physical therapist based on their observations during study sessions. In a sample of survivors of stroke, we demonstrated that the hip exosuit was able to deliver low, comfortable levels of hip ﬂexion assistive forces. When powered, the exosuit effectively increased thigh angle and angular velocity during paretic swing phase compared to unpowered con- dition. These preliminary ﬁndings highlight the feasibility for clinicians to use a hip exosuit to directly target deﬁcits in limb advancement in hemiparetic gait.  1 Introduction  Stroke gait is slow, asymmetric, and metabolically inefﬁcient [1]. Motor deﬁcits of hip ﬂexors and ankle plantarﬂexors are known to contribute to impairments in gait speed and symmetry [2]. While several soft, modular, robotic systems seek to target the paretic ankle [3], actuating the hip may also augment locomotion in stroke. This study that assists hip ﬂexion during presents a proof-of-concept of a wearable exosuit walking in chronic stroke survivors.

Shorter, Student Member, IEEE, Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE    Abstract—Human joint impedance describes the dynamic relationship between perturbation induced change in position and the resulting response torque. Understanding the natural regulation of ankle impedance during locomotion is necessary to discern how humans interact with their environments, and provide a foundation for the design of biomimetic assistive devices and their control systems. This study estimates ankle impedance during terminal stance phase of walking using a parametric model consisting of stiffness, damping, and inertia. The model accurately described ankle torque, accounting for 90% ± 7.7% of the variance. Stiffness was found to decrease linearly from 3.7 to 2.1 Nm\/rad\/kg between 75% and 85% stance. Quasi-stiffness—the slope of the ankle’s torque-angle curve— showed a similar decreasing trend but was significantly larger at the onset of terminal stance phase. The damping component of impedance was constant during terminal stance phase, and was increased relative to values previously reported during early and in mid-stance phase, preparation for toe-off. Inertia estimates were consistent with previously reported inertia values for the human ankle. This study bridges a gap in our understanding of ankle impedance during walking, and provides new insight into how ankle is regulated during regions when substantial impedance mechanical energy is added.  indicating an  increase  in damping","id":"20da7dc0-1810-4b9b-b916-667ce39d761f"}

It is considered one of the most widely spread exercises for muscle sport training and is part of the competition movements comprised within olympic weight-lifting. In physical rehabilitation, squats are used for muscular recovery after different injuries of the lower limbs, especially the knee. In previous anterior cruciate ligament injuries, the mini- squats are generally used, in a knee flexion motion range from 0º to 50º because in this range the shear forces, the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral compression forces decrease related to greater flexion angles. The aim of this work is to make a comparative bidimensional study of the kinematic and dynamic variables of the excecution of the parallel squat exercise with the front and back bar. It is observed in the knee a better development of energy with the front bar, allowing a better muscular exercise with the same load. The mean power absorbed by the hip with the back bar is considerably greater, associated to the speed of the gesture.  1. Introduction","id":"f439f4af-c1b6-4231-8000-cba4de999567"}

Shepherd, Student Member, IEEE, and Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE  Abstract—Individuals with poststroke hemiparesis often exhibit mobility deﬁcits, particularly during tasks requiring high lower limb torques. The sit-to-stand transition is con- sistently marked by asymmetrical weight-bearing between the paretic and unaffected legs. One way to improve char- acteristics of stroke sit-to-stand may be to provide assis- tive knee extension torque with a powered exoskeleton. To perform research on the biomechanical effects of as- sisting sit-to-stand, a unilateral powered knee exoskeleton is required, which can accurately control torque. This pa- per introduces a novel series elastic actuator capable of producing the full torques and speeds required for sit-to- stand (80 Nm, 3 rad\/s). It utilizes a unique transmission conﬁguration with a series ﬁberglass beam spring that im- proves torque-control and reduces output impedance. The actuator is incorporated into a unilateral orthosis and a high-level sit-to-stand controller is implemented. A small validation study with three able-bodied subjects perform- ing sit-to-stand is presented, demonstrating the ability to appropriately provide assistance.  of the torque required for more normative sit-to-stand [5]. The knee may provide up to 70% of the mechanical work to com- plete the transition [6], so this deﬁcit leaves other joints or excessive pre-seat-off torso momentum to compensate. Knee strength is also a strong predictor of the ability to per- form independent sit-to-stand in more severely affected patients [7].  A knee exoskeleton providing extension assistance during sit-to-stand may be able to compensate for the missing knee torque and improve weight-bearing symmetry. To explore this concept, we plan to perform research with stroke subjects where assistivetorqueisprovidedbyakneeexoskeleton. Thisresearch is expected to determine the efﬁcacy of using such a device to improve sit-to-stand biomechanics.

Quinlivan, Sangjun Lee, Philippe Malcolm, Denise M. Rossi, Christopher Siviy and Conor J. Walsh  Abstract Mobility can be limited due to age or impairments. Wearable robotics provide the chance to increase mobility and thus independence. A powered soft exosuit was designed that assist with both ankle plantarﬂexion and hip ﬂexion through a multi-articular suit architecture. So far, the best method to reduce meta- bolic cost of human walking with external forces is unknown. Two basic control strategies are compared in this study: an ankle moment inspired controller (AMIC) and an ankle positive power inspired controller (APIC). Both controllers provided a similar amount of average positive exosuit power and reduced the net metabolic cost of walking by 15 %. These results suggest that average positive power could be more important than assistive moment during single stance for reducing metabolic cost. Further analysis must show if one of the approaches has advantages for wearers comfort, changes in walking kinetics and kinematics, balance related biomechanics, or electrical energy consumption.

In contrast, powered prostheses can potentially improve obstacle avoidance via their ability to add energy to the system. In past work, researchers have proposed stumble recovery systems for pow- ered prosthetic limbs that provide assistance in the event of a trip. However, these systems only aid recovery after an obstacle has disrupted the user’s gait and do not proactively help the amputee avoid obstacles. To address this problem, we designed an adaptive system that learns online to use kinematic data from the prosthetic limb to detect the user’s obstacle avoidance intent in early swing. When the system detects an obstacle, it alters the planned swing trajectory to help avoid trips. Additionally, the system uses a regression model to predict the required knee ﬂexion angle for the trip response. We validated the system by comparing obstacle avoidance success rates with and without the obstacle avoidance system. For a non-amputee subject wearing the prosthesis through an adapter, the trip avoidance system improved the obstacle negotiation success rate from 37% to 89%, while an amputee subject improved his success rate from 35% to 71% when compared to utilizing minimum jerk trajectories for the knee and ankle joints.  I. INTRODUCTION  Avoiding obstacles on the ground is a necessity for main- taining safety while performing a variety of locomotion tasks. This behavior requires anticipation of an obstacle and active leg control strategies to avoid it [1]. Transfemoral amputees, however, have a compromised ability to negotiate obstacles, as shown in Figure 1, as current prosthesis technology relies on mechanically passive knees that necessitate signiﬁcant compensation at the hip in order to replicate able-bodied trip recovery strategies [2]. Compromised ability to avoid and recover from trips may contribute to the large number of falls that leg amputees suﬀer. For instance, 58% of unilateral amputees reported a fall within a year [3]. Moreover, the fear of falling can cause amputees to avoid activity, leading to further deterioration of their physical condition [4].","id":"4c8f7d00-5e3c-447b-8b9a-93ba21ff1d0c"}

Modern control strategies for wearable robots are predicated on activity-speciﬁc implementations, and testing is usually limited to a single, ﬁxed activity within the laboratory (e.g., level ground walking). To accommodate various activities in real- world scenarios, control strategies mustinclude theability tosafely andseamlesslytransitionbetweenactivity-speciﬁccontrollers.One potential solution to this challenge is to the infer wearer’s intent using pattern recognition of locomotion sensor data. To this end, we developed an intent recognition framework implementing con- volutional neural networks with image encoding (i.e. spectrogram) that enables prediction of the upcoming locomotor activity of the wearer’s next step. In this letter, we describe our intent recog- nition system, comprised of a mel-spectrogram and subsequent neural network architecture. In addition, we analyzed the effect of sensor locations and modalities on the recognition system, and compared our proposed system to state-of-the-art locomotor intent recognition strategies. We were able to attain high classiﬁcation performance (error rate: 1.1%), which was comparable or better than previous systems.","id":"e815930a-60bf-4c0c-8dc3-a20a85265d84"}

Lerner, Diane L. Damiano, and Thomas C. Bulea, Member, IEEE  Abstract—Individuals with cerebral palsy frequently exhibit crouch gait, a pathological walking pattern characterized by excessive knee ﬂexion. Knowledge of the knee joint moment during crouch gait is necessary for the design and control of assistive devices used for treatment. Our goal was to 1) develop statistical models to estimate knee joint moment extrema and dynamic stiffness during crouch gait, and 2) use the models to es- timate the instantaneous joint moment during weight-acceptance. We retrospectively computed knee moments from 10 children with crouch gait and used stepwise linear regression to develop statistical models describing the knee moment features. The models explained at least 90% of the response value variability: peak moment in early (99%) and late (90%) stance, and dy- namic stiffness of weight-acceptance ﬂexion (94%) and extension (98%). We estimated knee extensor moment proﬁles from the predicted dynamic stiffness and instantaneous knee angle. This approach captured the timing and shape of the computed moment (root-mean-squared error: 2.64 Nm); including the predicted early-stance peak moment as a correction factor improved model performance (root-mean-squared error: 1.37 Nm). Our strategy provides a practical, accurate method to estimate the knee mo- ment during crouch gait, and could be used for real-time, adaptive control of robotic orthoses.

We recapitulate a control framework for Lagrangian hybrid systems, and show that regulat- ing a state varying energy function is equivalent to applying energy shaping and regulat- ing the system to a constant energy value. We then consider a simple one-dimensional hopping robot and show how energy shaping and regulation control can be used to gen- erate and transition between nearly globally stable hopping limit cycles. The principles from this example are then applied on two canonical walking models, the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) and compass gait biped, to generate and transition between locomotive gaits. These examples show that piecewise jumps in control parameters can be used to achieve stable changes in desired gait characteristics dynamically\/online.

The movie also ignores the importance of designing for the wearer’s safety. In Atlas, the suit design unnecessarily complicates emergency medical procedures. During a fight sequence, Lopez is injured and must be removed from the suit to receive medical care, thereby exposing her to attack; ideally, these medical devices would be built into the roomy interior of the suit or incor- porated into the existing points of contact between her body and the suit. The only problem that might be satisfactorily solved is cost, because the military in Atlas appears to be working with an unlimited budget.  In the Atlas universe, roboticists have ap- parently spent those 20 years creating exo- suits that can walk by themselves, although, in reality, an exoskeleton walking with a hu- man inside is the harder problem. Since the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge in 2015, bipedal walking robots have become common. However, in the case of an exo- skeleton, the wearer magnifies the difficulty of self- stabilization; the suit must maintain its balance with a person whose unpredict- able and unmodeled upper body movements ripple across their deformable, fluid body, introducing perturbations into the control system. To cope with these perturbations, real- world lower- body exoskeletons for para- plegics typically expect the wearer to use crutches as an aid while walking and for someone to externally assist the user in standing up or sitting down. To Atlas’ credit, a suit would be feasible in 20 years, espe- cially given the 2023 Wandercraft demon- stration in New York City with Kevin Piette, a paraplegic for more than 10 years (3).

In this study, a knee exoskeleton rehabilitation robot driven by a quasi-direct driver actuator is designed. The torque generation model is constructed based on the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network, and the knee joint torque is generated by sEMG and angle signal. A joint attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of torque generation model. The impedance control parameters are adaptively adjusted in accordance with the joint torque. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network is capable of effectively estimating torque, the mean MAE and CC of the proposed model are 1.141Nm and 93.7%, respectively. The optimized impedance control can optimize the initial value of the impedance parameter, which reduced the torque error by 5.54% and 50.64% at uphill tasks and walking task, respectively, and adaptively adjust the impedance parameter to ensure the coordination of the gait rehabilitation and the friendly human- robot interaction.

Gregg  Abstract—In this work, we introduce a novel approach to assistive exoskeleton (or powered orthosis) control which avoids needing task and gait phase information. Our approach is based on directly designing the Hamiltonian dynamics of the target closed-loop behavior, shaping the energy of the human and the robot. Relative to previous energy shaping controllers for assistive exoskeletons, we introduce ground reaction force and torque information into the target behavior deﬁnition, reformulate the kinematics so as to avoid explicit matching conditions due to under-actuation, and avoid the need to switch between swing and stance energy shapes. Our controller introduces new states into the target Hamiltonian energy that represent a virtual second leg that is connected to the physical leg using virtual springs. The impulse the human imparts to the physical leg is ampliﬁed and applied to the virtual leg, but the ground reaction force acts only on the physical leg. A state transformation allows the proposed control to be available using only encoders, an IMU, and ground reaction force sensors. We prove that this controller is stable and passive when acted on by the ground reaction force and demonstrate the controller’s strength amplifying behavior in a simulation. A linear analysis based on small signal assumptions allows us to explain the relationship between our tuning parameters and the frequency domain ampliﬁcation bandwidth.  I. INTRODUCTION  Recent advances in exoskeleton technology have resulted in a class of light-weight assistive lower-body exoskeletons that can reduce the muscle effort [1] or metabolic cost of locomotion [2]–[5]. These systems are a departure from the better known humanoid-like lower-body exoskeletons (e.g. HAL [6], ATLANTE [7], ReWalk [8], or Mina v2 [9]) in that they are designed not to impose kinematics but rather to be back-driven by the users, providing assistive torque to augment a human that remains in direct control of the limb kinematics. But a lack of control strategies that allow these devices to transition between the various tasks (such as walking at different speeds, over ramps, up stairs, etc.) is one of the key factors keeping them from practical application [10]. These transitions are critical for assisting people in activities of daily living (ADLs) which feature short bouts of walking on the order of 30 seconds [11].","id":"6c69aa59-8696-49af-9451-9e7d77427328"}

Understanding the physiological origin of these features is essential for enhancing the mobility of elderly people.  Despite previous efforts, the origin of both increased energetic cost (15-30% for the ages of 70-90, Fig-A, [1]) and slower preferred walking speed (0.2-0.5 ms-1 for the same ages) remains obscure. For example, it has been shown that none of the basal metabolism, mechanical work, and stability measures explain this inefficiency of elderly walking. Similarly, the cost of transport (CoT, metabolic energy cost per walking distance), a widely used criterion for preferred walking speed of animals, do not explain the slower preferred walking speed of elderlies, since the CoT- speed curve of elderlies does not shift towards slower speed (Fig-A). Identifying the origin of elderly gait remains a challenging problem, since it is difficult to control each physiological properties independently as all changes occur simultaneously along aging.  investigate the contribution of physiological changes to elderly gait in simulation.  Main Results We find that, as observed in elderly gait, the model simulating the common physiological changes shows an increased CoT (16%, Fig-B). However, optimizing for CoT does not suggest a slower preferred walking speed. Instead, we find that a slower preferred speed (by about 0.25 ms-1) in line with experimental observations emerges if the model is optimized for fatigue of transport (FoT, muscle fatigue per walking distance, Fig-C) or stress of transport (SoT, muscle stress per walking distance, Fig-D).  Our detailed model analysis of the contributing physiological changes further suggests that both the metabolic cost increase and the slower walking speed are mainly related to a reduction in muscle strength and mass in the elderly population. We also discuss the effect of other physiological changes and potential ramifications of these findings for improving mobility in elderlies.","id":"47ec1ba4-12ee-40e9-ab27-ab46ae242f22"}

A major contributor to walking deficits is impaired paretic ankle function. Impaired paretic ankle plantarflexion (PF) reduces forward propulsion symmetry and impaired paretic ankle dorsiflexion (DF) diminishes ground clearance during swing. We have developed soft wearable robots (soft exosuits) to assist paretic PF and DF during walking after stroke. Through experimental studies with poststroke patients, we have demonstrated that exosuits can improve forward propulsion symmetry and ground clearance in walking, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of walking. This paper presents an optimized soft exosuit aimed at use in clinical gait training for patients poststroke. The optimized exosuit is lightweight, easy to don and doff, and capable of efficiently delivering mechanical assistance to the paretic ankle. This paper focuses on the optimized controller that can deliver well-timed consistent ankle assistance to patients. A preliminary study was performed using this exosuit with three poststroke patients with heterogeneous gait patterns. Results showed that compared to a previously published controller, more consistent assistive force profiles could be delivered to individuals poststroke while consuming 50% less electrical power. Additionally, a preliminary biomechanical assessment was performed during overground walking. I. INTRODUCTION Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability [1], with 80% of survivors having locomotor impairments [2]. Individuals after stroke typically present with hemiparetic gait, characterized as slow, asymmetric, and inefficient [3]–[5]. A major contributor to poststroke locomotion is impaired paretic ankle function, specifically during the push-off and swing phases of the gait cycle [5]–[9]. During push-off, diminished paretic ankle plantarflexion (PF) function inhibits the paretic limb’s contribution to forward propulsion [6]–[8].

The purpose of this paper was to develop and clinically evaluate an untethered ankle exoskeleton with the ability to reduce the metabolic cost of walking in children and young adults with gait pathology from CP. We designed a battery-powered device consisting of an actuator-and-control module worn above the waist with a Bowden cable transmission used to provide torque to pulleys aligned with the ankle. Special consideration was made to minimize adding mass to the body, particu- larly distal portions of the lower-extremity. The exoskeleton provided plantar-ﬂexor assistance during the mid-to-late stance phase, controlledusing a real-time control algorithm and embedded sensors. We conducted a device feasibility and a pilot clinical evaluation study with ﬁve individuals with CP ages ﬁve through thirty years old. Participants completed an average of 130 min of exoskeleton-assisted walking practice. We observed a 19 ± 5% improvement in the metabolic cost of transport (p = 0.011) during walking with untethered exoskeleton assistance compared to how participants walked normally.

We designed a tethered ankle-foot prosthesis with two independently-actuated toes that are coordinated to provide plantarﬂexion and inversion-eversion torques. A Bowden cable tether provides series elasticity. The prosthesis is simple and lightweight, with a mass of 0.72 kg. Strain gauges on the toes measure torque with less than 1% RMS error. Benchtop tests demonstrated a rise time of less than 33 ms, peak torques of 250 N·m in plantarﬂexion and ±30 N·m in inversion-eversion, and peak power above 3 kW. The phase-limited closed-loop torque bandwidth is 20 Hz with a chirp from 10 to 90 N·m in plantarﬂexion, and 24 Hz with a chirp from −20 to 20 N·m in inversion. The system has low sensitivity to toe position disturbances at frequencies of up to 18 Hz. Walking trials with an amputee subject demonstrated RMS torque tracking errors of less than 5.1 N·m in plantarﬂexion and less than 1.5 N·m in inversion-eversion.

ACCEPTED JUNE, 2020 1  Abstract— Lower-limb exoskeletons are widely researched to improve walking performance and mobility. Low-level sensor-less exoskeleton motor control is attractive for consumer applications due to reduced device complexity and cost, but complex and variable transmission system configurations make the development of effective open-loop motor controllers that are responsive to user input challenging. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an open-loop motor control framework resulting in similar or greater performance vs. closed-loop torque control. We used generalized linear regression to develop two open-loop controllers by modeling motor current during exoskeleton-assisted walking; a “complex” model used desired torque and estimated ankle angular velocity as inputs, while a “simple” model used desired torque alone. Five participants walked at 1.0-1.3 m\/s on a treadmill with closed-loop and both open-loop controllers providing ankle exoskeleton assistance. Both open-loop current controllers had similar root-mean-squared torque tracking error (p=0.23) compared to the closed-loop torque-feedback controller. Both open-loop controllers had improved relative average torque production (p<0.001 complex, p=0.022 simple), lower power consumption (p<0.001 for both), and reduced operating noise (p=0.002 complex, p<0.001 simple) over the closed-loop controller. New control models developed for a different ankle exoskeleton configuration showed similar improvements (lower torque error, greater average and peak torque production, lower power consumption) over closed-loop control during over-ground walking. These results demonstrate that our framework can produce open-loop motor controllers that match closed-loop control performance during exoskeleton operation.

However, designing such a device for seamless integration with the human user and to assist human movement still is a major challenge. This paper aims at developing a novel data-driven solution framework based on reinforcement learning (RL), without first modeling the human-robot dynamics, to provide optimal and adaptive personalized torque assistance for reducing human efforts during walking. Our automatic personalization solution framework includes the assistive torque profile with two control timing parameters (peak and offset timings), the least square policy iteration (LSPI) for learning the parameter tuning policy, and a cost function based on transferred work ratio. The proposed controller was successfully validated on a healthy human subject to assist unilateral hip extension in walking. The results showed that the optimal and adaptive RL controller as a new approach was feasible for tuning assistive torque profile of the hip exoskeleton that coordinated with human actions and reduced activation level of hip extensor muscle in human.  Wherein, hip flexion\/extension were actively actuated by the SEAs while abduction\/adduction were passive. A robotic hip exoskeleton was developed by Chen et al [10] to support lift movement assistance of heavy tasks with hip flexion and extension movements, which was powered by two SEAs that achieved a peak torque of 22 Nm. Masood et al [11] have developed a robotic exoskeleton with 12 DOFs to assist able-bodied people with manual handling tasks. Only hip flexion and extension were active with an output torque of approximately 53 Nm but a weight of 11.6 kg, which were actuated by two parallel elastic actuators (PEAs). Our previously developed a SEA-driven 4-DOF hip exoskeleton, called NREL-Exo, in which both hip flexion\/extension and hip adduction\/abduction were actively controlled [12]-[14]. While these devices have achieved some level of success, they are restrained by the SEA for a narrow bandwidth and limited stiffness range. Additionally, their bulkiness also limits their application. In this paper, we present a newly developed lightweight, compact, compliant, and modular 2-DOF robotic hip exoskeleton with powered flexion and extension motions.","id":"10daf62f-78b2-41ff-9aaf-195c818d2fbc"}

Gregg  Abstract—In this work, we introduce a novel approach to assistive exoskeleton (or powered orthosis) control which avoids needing task and gait phase information. Our approach is based on directly designing the Hamiltonian dynamics of the target closed-loop behavior, shaping the energy of the human and the robot. Relative to previous energy shaping controllers for assistive exoskeletons, we introduce ground reaction force and torque information into the target behavior deﬁnition, reformulate the kinematics so as to avoid explicit matching conditions due to under-actuation, and avoid the need to switch between swing and stance energy shapes. Our controller introduces new states into the target Hamiltonian energy that represent a virtual second leg that is connected to the physical leg using virtual springs. The impulse the human imparts to the physical leg is ampliﬁed and applied to the virtual leg, but the ground reaction force acts only on the physical leg. A state transformation allows the proposed control to be available using only encoders, an IMU, and ground reaction force sensors. We prove that this controller is stable and passive when acted on by the ground reaction force and demonstrate the controller’s strength amplifying behavior in a simulation. A linear analysis based on small signal assumptions allows us to explain the relationship between our tuning parameters and the frequency domain ampliﬁcation bandwidth.  I. INTRODUCTION  Recent advances in exoskeleton technology have resulted in a class of light-weight assistive lower-body exoskeletons that can reduce the muscle effort [1] or metabolic cost of locomotion [2]–[5]. These systems are a departure from the better known humanoid-like lower-body exoskeletons (e.g. HAL [6], ATLANTE [7], ReWalk [8], or Mina v2 [9]) in that they are designed not to impose kinematics but rather to be back-driven by the users, providing assistive torque to augment a human that remains in direct control of the limb kinematics. But a lack of control strategies that allow these devices to transition between the various tasks (such as walking at different speeds, over ramps, up stairs, etc.) is one of the key factors keeping them from practical application [10]. These transitions are critical for assisting people in activities of daily living (ADLs) which feature short bouts of walking on the order of 30 seconds [11].","id":"6c69aa59-8696-49af-9451-9e7d77427328"}

In this study we compared three different modelling frameworks to estimate knee torque in non-weight-bearing situations. The ﬁrst model contained a convolutional neural network (CNN) which mapped EMG to knee torque directly. The second used a neuromusculoskeletal model (NMS) which used EMG, muscle tendon unit lengths and moment arms to compute knee torque. The third model (Hybrid) used a CNN to map EMG to speciﬁc muscle activation, which was used together with NMS components to compute knee torque. Multi-day measurements were conducted on ten able-bodied participants who performed non-weight bearing activities. CNN had the best performance in general and on each day (Normalized Root Mean Squared (NRMSE 12.4 ± 3.4%) was able to Error (NRMSE) 9.2 ± 4.4%). The Hybrid model outperform NMS (NRMSE 14.3 ± 4.2%).

Bulea*  The ability to walk contributes considerably to physical health and overall well-being, particularly in children with motor disability, and is therefore prioritized as a rehabilitation goal. However, half of ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent childhood movement disorder, cease to walk in adulthood. Robotic gait trainers have shown positive outcomes in initial studies, but these clinic-based systems are limited to short- term programs of insufficient length to maintain improved function in a lifelong disability such as CP. Sophisticated wearable exoskeletons are now available, but their utility in treating childhood movement dis- orders remains unknown. We evaluated an exoskeleton for the treatment of crouch (or flexed-knee) gait, one of the most debilitating pathologies in CP. We show that the exoskeleton reduced crouch in a cohort of ambula- tory children with CP during overground walking. The exoskeleton was safe and well tolerated, and all children were able to walk independently with the device. Rather than guiding the lower limbs, the exoskeleton dynam- ically changed the posture by introducing bursts of knee extension assistance during discrete portions of the walking cycle, a perturbation that resulted in maintained or increased knee extensor muscle activity during exoskeleton use. Six of seven participants exhibited postural improvements equivalent to outcomes reported from invasive orthopedic surgery. We also demonstrate that improvements in crouch increased over the course of our multiweek exploratory trial. Together, these results provide evidence supporting the use of wearable exoskeletons as a treatment strategy to improve walking in children with CP.","id":"4094a703-5030-44a2-9210-896044439fb7"}

The multi-disc brake provides resistive torque through a stack of friction discs which are compressed by a dc-motor-driven ball screw. Unlike nearly all other proportional brakes, which operate in a normally unlocked mode, the brake presented here is designed such that it may be configured in either a normally unlocked or normally locked mode. The latter enables lower electrical energy consumption and added safety in the event of electrical power failure in certain applications. Following the device description, experimental data is presented to characterize the performance of the brake. The performance characteristics are subsequently compared to those of a commercially available magnetic particle brake of comparable size. I. INTRODUCTION everal control applications require the use of an electrically controllable proportional rotary brake (e.g., [1]-[16]). Probably the most common and thoroughly developed example of such a device is the magnetic particle brake (MPB). Magnetic particle brakes produce a steady-state resistive torque roughly proportional to the input current. A sectioned view of a magnetic particle brake is shown in Figure 1. DC current applied to the brake coil induces a magnetic field which links fine ferrite particles to the rotating brake shaft. The amount of current in the coil determines the strength of the magnetic field, which in turn determines the resistive torque imposed on the brake shaft. Compared with the closed-loop control of a high-performance DC torque motor, these devices provide a relatively low-power and light-weight means of exerting controlled dissipative mechanical torque. Further, using an electric motor as a dissipater requires measurement of velocity, which typically contains phase lag, which in turn adds (rather than dissipates) energy to the system. A proportional brake, on the other hand, does not require velocity measurement and is guaranteed to be energetically passive. Though the weight of a magnetic particle brake is low relative to a DC motor (for a given resistive torque), in many cases the weight remains significant","id":"609e9e09-a714-4fc1-bece-941ab5dbeefd"}

Azocar, Student Member, IEEE and Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE    Abstract—Objective: Recently, human joint impedance—the instantaneous mechanical response to a perturbation—has been quantified during gait, providing new insight beyond the traditional biomechanical descriptions of kinetics and kinematics. However, the role of joint impedance in neuromotor control and the development of exoskeletons and other wearable robotic systems remains unknown. One approach to studying the role of impedance in neuromotor control involves characterizing the human ability to discriminate changes in external impedance properties. Thus, the purpose of this work is to quantify the minimum detectable change in the stiffness component of interacting with an external mechanical impedance when impedance at the human ankle or knee. Methods: A dynamometer coupled to subjects’ right ankle or knee rendered the dynamics of a virtual rotational spring-damper system. The minimum detectable change, or just noticeable difference, was determined via a weighted up-down staircase method in which subjects compared the stiffness values of two different controller configurations. Results: We found that subjects could reliably detect stiffness changes of at least 12% at the ankle and 13% at the knee. Conclusion: Stiffness errors or variations produced by an external mechanical device will be undetected if they remain below the 12% to 13% threshold. Significance: Our results provide novel insight into how the sensorimotor system senses joint impedance, information which may improve the design and control of impedance-based wearable robotic technologies.","id":"3361267d-2a87-4483-8231-ff05c76d93e2"}

Since the energy supplied by the proposed EMG is discontinuous in time, a tailored energy management circuit is necessary to adapt the harvested energy to the load energy requirements. The electromechanical generator is composed by two series of NdFeB magnets positioned into each condyle and a coil, placed in the pin of the tibial insert, which collects the magnetic flux variations, generated by the knee movements. A total knee replacement (TKR) prototype has been developed and realized in order to reproduce the knee mechanics. Therefore, electrical performances have been evaluated, at the first, measuring the EMG open circuit voltage by means of a high impedance buffer amplifier, and, subsequently, connecting the EMG to the energy management circuit able to manage the produced energy and to power an implanted circuit for force measurement inside the human knee. The tests showed that the EHS is able to supply the measuring circuit guaranteeing a tension between 2.45 V and 2.15 V for 25 ms almost every 1.5 s with a walking velocity of 1 Hz. The tests successfully demonstrate the possibility to power a measurement circuit transmitting the measurement data outside the prosthesis every about one-step and half.

Walsh1,2  , Denise Martineli Rossi1,2,4, Christopher Siviy1,2, Sangjun Lee1,2,  Abstract  Background: Different groups developed wearable robots for walking assistance, but there is still a need for methods to quickly tune actuation parameters for each robot and population or sometimes even for individual users. Protocols where parameters are held constant for multiple minutes have traditionally been used for evaluating responses to parameter changes such as metabolic rate or walking symmetry. However, these discrete protocols are time-consuming. Recently, protocols have been proposed where a parameter is changed in a continuous way. The aim of the present study was to compare effects of continuously varying assistance magnitude with a soft exosuit against discrete step conditions.  Methods: Seven participants walked on a treadmill wearing a soft exosuit that assists plantarflexion and hip flexion. In Continuous-up, peak exosuit ankle moment linearly increased from approximately 0 to 38% of biological moment over 10 min. Continuous-down was the opposite. In Discrete, participants underwent five periods of 5 min with steady peak moment levels distributed over the same range as Continuous-up and Continuous-down. We calculated metabolic rate for the entire Continuous-up and Continuous-down conditions and the last 2 min of each Discrete force level. We compared kinematics, kinetics and metabolic rate between conditions by curve fitting versus peak moment. Results: Reduction in metabolic rate compared to Powered-off was smaller in Continuous-up than in Continuous- down at most peak moment levels, due to physiological dynamics causing metabolic measurements in Continuous- up and Continuous-down to lag behind the values expected during steady-state testing. When evaluating the average slope of metabolic reduction over the entire peak moment range there was no significant difference between Continuous-down and Discrete. Attempting to correct the lag in metabolics by taking the average of Continuous-up and Continuous-down removed all significant differences versus Discrete. For kinematic and kinetic parameters, there were no differences between all conditions.","id":"d9723c08-0ef0-4b1c-970a-35a437606e1a"}

ACCEPTED JUNE, 2022 1 Abstract— The widespread adoption of powered lower-limb exoskeletons for augmenting mobility requires energy-efficient actuation to provide meaningful assistance over relevant walking durations. We designed, modeled, and validated an ankle exoskeleton design with a parallel elastic element in the form of a carbon fiber leaf spring that stored and returned energy in parallel to a cable-drive ankle joint during stance phase. We assessed the impact of the parallel elastic element on the performance of the untethered robotic ankle exoskeleton at walking speeds of 0.75-1.25 m\/s using a previously validated-controller, and a controller designed specifically to maximize the spring’s benefit. The spring selected for our adult cohort had a stiffness of 97.2 Nm\/rad, engaged best at 0-degrees ankle dorsiflexion, and produced 10-15 Nm peak assistive torque at all walking speeds. When tracking the previously validated exoskeleton controller, peak motor current was reduced by 14-20% and integrated current was reduced by 16-19% for parallel-elastic design vs. without spring engagement; this translated to 15-26% more assisted steps for the same battery capacity. When utilizing the controller designed to take advantage of the parallel spring torque, the number of assisted steps for the same battery capacity increased 46-76% compared to the no spring configuration depending on walking speed. Seeking to facilitate real-world adoption, this powered parallel elastic ankle exoskeleton design holds potential to significantly extend powered walking duration, and improve battery and motor life of operation by reducing peak and mean motor current requirements.

The Relationship Between Joint Strength and Standing Vertical Jump Performance  Kuangyou B. Cheng National Cheng Kung University  The effect of joint strengthening on standing vertical jump height is investigated by computer simulation. The human model consists of five rigid segments representing the feet, shanks, thighs, HT (head and trunk), and arms. Segments are connected by frictionless revolute joints and model movement is driven by joint torque actuators. Each joint torque is the product of maximum isometric torque and three variable functions of instantaneous joint angle, angular velocity, and activation level, respectively. Jumping movements starting from a balanced ini- tial posture and ending at takeoff are simulated. A matching simulation reproducing the actual jumping movement is generated by optimizing joint activation level. Simulations with the goal of maximizing jump height are repeated for varying maximum isometric torque of one joint by up to ±20% while keeping other joint strength values unchanged. Similar to previous studies, reoptimization of activation after joint strengthening is necessary for increasing jump height. The knee and ankle are the most effective joints in changing jump height (by as much as 2.4%, or 3 cm). For the same amount of percentage increase\/ decrease in strength, the shoulder is the least effective joint (which changes height by as much as 0.6%), but its influence should not be overlooked.  Keywords: strengthening, joint torque, muscular activation, optimization, simulation  height have been investigated by mathematical models of increasing complexity (Levine et al., 1983a, 1983b; Pandy et al., 1990; Van Soest et al., 1993; Selbie & Caldwell, 1996). Ground reaction forces (GRF), muscle electromyogram (EMG), and joint kinematics have been measured by numerous experimental studies (Bobbert & Van Ingen Schenau, 1988; Lees et al., 2004). Other researchers (Alexander, 1990; Seyfarth et al., 1999, 2000) used simple dynamic models to understand optimal run- ning high- and long-jumping strategies.","id":"dbb48d01-4473-4c2b-8bd1-49e2f5c6dd81"}

Murray, Student Member, IEEE, and Michael Goldfarb, Member, IEEE  Abstract—This paper describes a hybrid system that combines a powered lower limb exoskeleton with functional electrical stimu- lation (FES) for gait restoration in persons with paraplegia. The general control structure consists of two control loops: a motor control loop, which utilizes joint angle feedback control to control the output of the joint motor to track the desired joint trajecto- ries, and a muscle control loop, which utilizes joint torque proﬁles from previous steps to shape the muscle stimulation proﬁle for the subsequent step in order to minimize the motor torque contribu- tion required for joint angle trajectory tracking. The implementa- tion described here incorporates stimulation of the hamstrings and quadriceps muscles, such that the hip joints are actuated by the combination of hip motors and the hamstrings, and the knee joints are actuated by the combination of knee motors and the quadri- ceps. In order to demonstrate efﬁcacy, the control approach was implemented on three paraplegic subjects with motor complete spinal cord injuries ranging from levels T6 to T10.

However, designing such a device for seamless integration with the human user and to assist human movement still is a major challenge. This paper aims at developing a novel data-driven solution framework based on reinforcement learning (RL), without first modeling the human-robot dynamics, to provide optimal and adaptive personalized torque assistance for reducing human efforts during walking. Our automatic personalization solution framework includes the assistive torque profile with two control timing parameters (peak and offset timings), the least square policy iteration (LSPI) for learning the parameter tuning policy, and a cost function based on transferred work ratio. The proposed controller was successfully validated on a healthy human subject to assist unilateral hip extension in walking. The results showed that the optimal and adaptive RL controller as a new approach was feasible for tuning assistive torque profile of the hip exoskeleton that coordinated with human actions and reduced activation level of hip extensor muscle in human.  Wherein, hip flexion\/extension were actively actuated by the SEAs while abduction\/adduction were passive. A robotic hip exoskeleton was developed by Chen et al [10] to support lift movement assistance of heavy tasks with hip flexion and extension movements, which was powered by two SEAs that achieved a peak torque of 22 Nm. Masood et al [11] have developed a robotic exoskeleton with 12 DOFs to assist able-bodied people with manual handling tasks. Only hip flexion and extension were active with an output torque of approximately 53 Nm but a weight of 11.6 kg, which were actuated by two parallel elastic actuators (PEAs). Our previously developed a SEA-driven 4-DOF hip exoskeleton, called NREL-Exo, in which both hip flexion\/extension and hip adduction\/abduction were actively controlled [12]-[14]. While these devices have achieved some level of success, they are restrained by the SEA for a narrow bandwidth and limited stiffness range. Additionally, their bulkiness also limits their application. In this paper, we present a newly developed lightweight, compact, compliant, and modular 2-DOF robotic hip exoskeleton with powered flexion and extension motions.","id":"10daf62f-78b2-41ff-9aaf-195c818d2fbc"}

Heart rate was the highest in squat and lowest in stoop respectively, with a middle level in semi-squat lifting. It may be recommended to adopt mainly the semi-squat technique for daily lifting works. For heavy lifting, it should use the squat technique.

The exosuit combines textile garments with cable driven actuators and is lighter and more compliant as compared to traditional rigid exoskeletons. By avoiding the use of rigid elements, exosuits offer greater comfort, facilitate donning\/doffing, and do not impose kinematic restrictions on the wearer – all while retaining the ability to generate significant moments at target joints during walking. The stroke-specific exosuit adapted from previous exosuit designs provides unilateral assistance to the paretic limb during walking. This paper describes stroke- specific design considerations, the design of the textile components, the development of a research-focused, mobile off-board actuation unit capable of testing the exosuit in a variety of walking conditions, a real-time gait detection and control algorithm, and proof-of-principle data validating the use of the exosuit in the chronic stroke population. Ultimately, we demonstrate reliable tracking of poststroke gait, appropriate timing of assistive forces, and improvements in key gait metrics. These preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of exosuits for poststroke gait assistance and training. Future work will involve the creation of a portable, body-worn system based on the specifications obtained from such feasibility studies that will enable community-based rehabilitation.","id":"8c79421f-2f61-4f21-a86c-5af86fe0afbd"}

To overcome some limitations of previous wearable walking assistance devices, 3 novel mechanisms are proposed: 1) flexible thigh frames that withstand the designated load direction, 2) an adjustable flexible hip brace surrounding the wearer’s body, and 3) slim and backdrivable actuators that minimize the maximum height and resistance.

The control system was implemented on a powered prosthesis and evaluated on a single unilateral transtibial amputee subject. The ability of the prosthesis to provide appropriate functionality during stair ascent and descent was assessed by comparing gait kinematics and kinetics of the prosthesis to those of a passive dynamic elastic response prosthesis and those of a set of non- amputee subjects.

Additionally, the spring-like nature of DER prostheses does not allow for the substantial power dissipation following foot strike that characterizes non-amputee stair descent.  Recent advances in prosthetic technology have introduced powered ankle-foot prostheses, which are potentially capable of better replicating non-amputee human biomechanics than corresponding passive prostheses. Multiple powered transtibial prostheses have been introduced in research literature over the last decade, such as those described in [6]–[10]. Despite the emergence of these devices, little work has been published on control methods of stair ascent and descent for them (with the exception of [11] and [12], to be discussed sub- sequently).

This study presents an exoskeleton that boosts vertical jumping—a fast, short movement during which the muscles are exerted at peak capacity. It was hypothesized that a passive exoskeleton would increase vertical jump height without requiring exter- nal energy input. The device comprises springs that work in parallel with the muscles of the quadriceps femoris. The springs store mechanical energy during knee ﬂexion (the negative work phase) and release that energy during the subsequent knee extension (the positive work phase), augmenting the muscles. Ten healthy participants were evaluatedin two experimental sessions. In the ﬁrst session, the participants jumped without receiving instructions on how to use the exoskeleton, and the results showed no dif- ference in jump height when jumping with the exoskeleton orjumpingwithoutit.Inthesecondsession,theparticipants were instructedto achievedeeperinitialsquatheightsat the start of the jump. This resultedin a 6.4% increasein average jump height compared to jumping without the exoskeleton (each participant performed ﬁve jumps for each the two conditions).

The off-board system consists an actuation unit with two degrees of freedom that can transmit forces to our soft exosuit via Bowden cables. To perform accurate force tracking and cable slack management, we implemented a switching admittance-position control approach that utilizes the advantages of both admittance and position control. In particular, feedforward models (FFMs) are added to the admittance control to compensate variability of individual kinematics, nonlinear hip exosuit stiffness and actuator transmission loss to enable a more accurate force tracking. This system allows us to track force profiles accurately and robustly under normal walking or jogging speed. The performance of force tracking was evaluated on three subjects walking on a treadmill at 1.25 m\/s with various magnitude, shape, and timings of assistive profiles and jogging on a treadmill at 2.3 m\/s with varied magnitude of a representative assistance profile. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across different profiles. In case of walking experiments, the errors of the magnitude, RMS-E, and timing were within 2.0 N, 8.4 N, and 1.8% when varying the magnitude, shape, and timing respectively. In case of jogging experiments, the RMS-E was within 3.0 N. This system will be used for future research examining how to individualize assistive profiles for different wearers during walking and jogging. I. INTRODUCTION In the past decades, lower-limb exoskeletons have been drawing intense research interest because of their potential applications to assist or augment human performances for various purposes. Some of the exoskeletons are designed to support and train a paraplegic’s body [1]–[7], while others improve the walking efficiency of able-bodied individuals, especially in case of load-carrying [8]–[11]. The majority of these devices consist of rigid structures, which are favorable for supporting the carried load or body weight and producing high assistive force to the wearer. However, the rigid nature can interfere natural movement of the wearer when the exoskeleton joints are misaligned with biological joints or the degree of freedom are not supported [12]–[14]. Moreover, the large inertia of rigid structures on the distal locations can significantly increase the wearer’s net metabolic rate when they are not fully compensated [8]","id":"fdcad11e-742e-4a55-80e0-fe8aa5773705"}

Article deals with the analysis of design exoskeleton for people with disabilities, in order to analyze significant events that are currently crucial in the creation or modification of various visual styles in design. The exoskeleton is carryable robotic device connected to the human body. Its design and of course its functionality modified and improved in time. Aesthetics of exoskeletons was influenced by on which elements they are based in designing - the predominance of a particular element decides how it is eventually perceived. An important part of creating ideas is to establish criteria that will set the direction and certain limits. The objective is also to find the most important connectins of shape, color and material features that make up a coherent design. Introduction The English word design is derived from the Latin de-signare, meaning to mark or indicate and in time the terms such as a proposal or to design were implemented. The aim of the design is to link the functional and aesthetic aspects of the proposed device in the most rational way, which requires technical and artistic skills and knowledge. The design is extremely varied, vital and ever-changing issue, different categories of which are complementary. It is present in many forms from useful and beautiful objects to waste, air pollution, disposal of mineral resources, transportation and environmental collapse, but it may help the sick, the elderly and handicapped. The presence of design is all around us. Initial impression For simple assessment the criteria of excellence of design we do not need to be experts in the field. Each of us is able to conclude whether a particular aesthetic appearance of the object acts upon us positively or negatively. If the effect is negative, there is sometning wrong in the proposal. The designer would therefore cooperate in the process of creating the draft not only with constructor, but also with doctor, psychologist and other professionals dealing fox example with physiology.

We present the design and control of a multimodal locomotion robotic platform called LEONARDO, which bridges the gap between two different loco- motion regimes of flying and walking using synchronized control of distributed electric thrusters and a pair of multijoint legs. By combining two distinct locomotion mechanisms, LEONARDO achieves complex maneuvers that require delicate balancing, such as walking on a slackline and skateboarding, which are challenging for existing bipedal robots. LEONARDO also demonstrates agile walking motions, interlaced with flying maneuvers to over- come obstacles using synchronized control of propellers and leg joints.

First published Feb- ruary 24, 2016; doi:10.1152\/jn.00941.2015.—Movements can be learned implicitly in response to new environmental demands or explicitly through instruction and strategy. The former is often studied in an environment that perturbs movement so that people learn to correct the errors and store a new motor pattern. Here, we demonstrate in human walking that implicit learning of foot placement occurs even when an explicit strategy is used to block changes in foot placement during the learning process. We studied people learning a new walking pattern on a split-belt treadmill with and without an explicit strategy through instruction on where to step. When there is no instruction, subjects implicitly learn to place one foot in front of the other to minimize step-length asymmetry during split-belt walking, and the learned pattern is maintained when the belts are returned to the same speed, i.e., postlearning. When instruction is provided, we block expression of the new foot-placement pattern that would otherwise naturally develop from adaptation. Despite this appearance of no learning in foot placement, subjects show similar postlearning effects as those who were not given any instruction. Thus locomotor adap- tation is not dependent on a change in action during learning but instead can be driven entirely by an unexpressed internal recalibration of the desired movement.  adaptation; feedback; gait; motor learning; walking","id":"c523e5e1-9674-4b0e-bf47-7cb6ded595c2"}

A representative dataset for training data-driven models is crucial to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. However, the acquisition of sufﬁcient data is time-consuming and often infeasible. We present a method to create realistic inertial sensor data with corresponding biomechanical variables by 2D walking and running simulations. We augmented a measured inertial sensor dataset with simulated data for the training of convolutional neural networks to estimate sagittal plane joint angles, joint moments, and ground reaction forces (GRFs) of walking and running. When adding simulated data, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the test set of hip, knee, and ankle joint angles decreased up to 17%, 27% and 23%, the RMSE of knee and ankle joint moments up to 6% and the RMSE of anterior-posterior and vertical GRF up to 2and 6%. Simulation-aided estimation of joint moments and GRFs was limited by inaccuracies of the biomechanical model. Improving the physics-based model and domain adaptation learning may further increase the beneﬁt of simulated data. Future work can exploit biomechanical simulations to connect different data sources in order to create representative datasets of human movement.

L. Philip Chen , Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—A novel neuro-fuzzy model named fuzzy broad learning system (BLS) is proposed by merging the Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system into BLS. The fuzzy BLS replaces the feature nodes of BLS with a group of TS fuzzy subsystems, and the input data are processed by each of them. Instead of aggregating the outputs of fuzzy rules produced by every fuzzy subsystem into one value immediately, all of them are sent to the enhance- ment layer for further nonlinear transformation to preserve the characteristic of inputs. The defuzziﬁcation outputs of all fuzzy subsystem and the outputs of enhancement layer are combined together to obtain the model output. The k-means method is employed to determine the centers of Gaussian membership func- tions in antecedent part and the number of fuzzy rules. The parameters that need to be calculated in a fuzzy BLS are the weights connecting the outputs of enhancement layer to model output and the randomly initialized coefﬁcients of polynomials in consequent part in fuzzy subsystems, which can be calculated analytically. Therefore, fuzzy BLS retains the fast computational nature of BLS. The proposed fuzzy BLS is evaluated by some pop- ular benchmarks for regression and classiﬁcation, and compared with some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches. The results indicate that fuzzy BLS outperforms other models involved. Moreover, fuzzy BLS shows advantages over neuro- fuzzy models regarding to the number of fuzzy rules and training time, which can ease the problem of rule explosion to some extent.  I.

Huang* and Arthur D. Kuo  to greater metabolic energy expenditure. This underscores the need for a mechanistic explanation for the metabolic cost of walking as a function of load.  ABSTRACT Although humans clearly expend more energy to walk with an extra load, it is unclear what biomechanical mechanisms contribute to that increase. One possible contribution is the mechanical work performed on the body center of mass (COM), which simple models predict should increase linearly with added mass. The work should be performed primarily by the lower extremity joints, although in unknown distribution, and cost a proportionate amount of metabolic energy. We therefore tested normal adults (N=8) walking at constant speed (1.25 m s−1) with varying backpack loads up to 40% of body weight. We measured mechanical work (both performed on the COM and joint work from inverse dynamics), as well as metabolic energy expenditure through respirometry. Both measures of work were found to increase approximately linearly with carried load, with COM work rate increasing by approximately 1.40 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The joints all contributed work, but the greatest increase in positive work was attributable to the ankle during push-off (45–60% of stride time) and the knee in the rebound after collision (12–30% stride). The hip performed increasing amounts of negative work, near the end of stance. Rate of metabolic energy expenditure also increased approximately linearly with load, by approximately 7.6 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The ratio of the increases in work and metabolic cost yielded a relatively constant efficiency of approximately 16%. The metabolic cost not explained by work appeared to be relatively constant with load and did not exhibit a particular trend. Most of the increasing cost for carrying a load appears to be explained by positive mechanical work, especially about the ankle and knee, with both work and metabolic cost increasing nearly linearly with added mass.","id":"6c4cdecc-424a-46d3-97c8-949e0fbbaac1"}

INTRODUCTION Spinal cord injury is a devastating condition with no available cure to date. Despite ongoing research in areas such as stem cell therapy and neuronal regeneration, these fields are still in preclinical states and thus far have made little clinical impact at the patient level. On the other hand, functional electrical stimulation (FES) is already in use in areas such as breathing, bowel and bladder function, and hand grasp [1, 2]. In the past few decades, many researchers have developed FES-based gait restoration systems for persons with paraplegia [3-6], including the commercially-available Parastep system [7]. However, these devices have shown limited everyday usability due to some key limitations such as muscle fatigue, uneven muscle response, and lack of sensing for control purposes, resulting in limited run time and inconsistent gait motions [1, 8]. Some researchers have addressed these problems using hybrid systems combining FES with computer-controlled passive lower limb braces [9-14]. Others have developed fully-powered, electric motor-actuated lower limb exoskeletons without the use of FES [15-22].

Rouse1, Luke M. Mooney2 and Hugh M. Herr1,3  Abstract Currently, the mobility of above-knee amputees is limited by the lack of available prostheses that can efficiently replicate biologically accurate movements. In this study, a powered knee prosthesis was designed utilizing a novel mechanism, known as a clutchable series-elastic actuator (CSEA).The CSEA includes a low-power clutch in parallel with an electric motor within a traditional series-elastic actuator. The stiffness of the series elasticity was tuned to match the elastically conservative region of the knee’s torque-angle relationship during the stance phase of locomotion. During this region, the clutch was used to efficiently store energy in the series elasticity. The fully autonomous knee prosthesis design utilized a brushless electric motor, ballscrew transmission and cable drive, as well as commercial electrical components. The knee was lighter than the eighth percentile and shorter than the first percentile male shank segment. The CSEA Knee was tested in a unilateral above-knee amputee walking at 1.3 m\/s. During walking, the CSEA Knee provided biomechanically accurate torque-angle behavior, agreeing within 17% of the net work and 27% of the stance flexion angle produced by the biological knee. In addition, the process of locomotion reduced the net electrical energy consumption of the CSEA Knee. The knee’s motor generated 1.8 J\/stride, and the net energy consumption was 3.6 J\/stride, an order of magnitude less energy than previously published powered knee prostheses.

Back- support devices have been developed to mitigate these injuries by aiding workers during lifting tasks. However, existing devices often fall short in providing multidimensional force assistance for asymmetric lifting, an essential feature for practical workplace use. In addition, validation of device safety across the entire human spine has been lacking. This paper introduces the Bilateral Back Extensor Exosuit (BBEX), a robotic back- support device designed to address both functionality and safety concerns. The design of the BBEX draws inspiration from the anatomical characteristics of the human spine and back extensor muscles. Using a multi–degree- of- freedom architecture and serially connected linear actuators, the device’s components are strategically arranged to closely mimic the bio- mechanics of the human spine and back extensor muscles. To establish the efficacy and safety of the BBEX, a series of experiments with human participants was conducted. Eleven healthy male participants engaged in symmetric and asymmetric lifting tasks while wearing the BBEX. The results confirm the ability of the BBEX to provide effec- tive multidimensional force assistance. Moreover, comprehensive safety validation was achieved through analy- ses of muscle fatigue in the upper and the lower erector spinae muscles, as well as mechanical loading on spinal joints during both lifting scenarios. By seamlessly integrating functionality inspired by human biomechanics with a focus on safety, this study offers a promising solution to address the persistent challenge of preventing lumbar spine injuries in demanding work environments.","id":"2936ec0b-661d-4df7-845f-e0693e870c45"}

Different computational processing models were developed for the user and the unit. A processing method was proposed in which inverse dynamics analysis is used to calculate the assist moment from user processing and the system weight compensation from unit processing. A floor reaction force for the system weight compensation processing method was established to allow system weight compensation control. A high degree of stability in the vector orientation of the floor reaction force for system weight compensation was shown in tests. In addition, this method enables estimation of the user’s floor reaction force vector by applying the user’s dynamics model. Thus, it was shown that there are good prospects for the realization of a user-friendly walking assist system that does not employ floor reaction force sensors in the system.  1. Introduction  It is predicted that the aging of Japanese society will continue to increase in pace in the future. The elderly tend to withdraw from participation in society when they begin to lose confidence in their health or physical strength(1). Taking this social background into consideration, Honda is seeking to contribute to supporting the lives of the elderly by conducting research on a wearable walking assist system that reduces the load on the body during movement. Prioritizing the comfort of the user, the goal of the research is to realize a “user-friendly walking assist system.” Research to date has focused on enabling the motion of the system to follow the user’s intentions, and has sketched an outline of a system using a proposed joint moment assist method that estimates joint moment as the user is moving and provides assist power depending on the estimated joint moment(2).  In an attempt to increase the user-friendliness of the system, the goal of the research discussed in this paper was to help prevent the user from having to support the  weight of the system, through the development of a new control method that enables the weight of the system to be compensated at the same time as assist is provided to the user.  2.

In this study, we examined hip and knee joint kinetics during stair climbing in 35 young healthy subjects using a subject-speciﬁc knee model to estimate bone-on-bone tibiofemoral and patello-femoral joint contact forces. The net knee forces were below one body weight while the peak posterior–anterior contact force was close to one body weight. The peak distal–proximal contact force was on average 3 times body weight and could be as high as 6 times body weight. These contact forces occurred at a high degree of knee ﬂexion where there is a smaller joint contact area resulting in high contact stresses. The peak knee adduction moment was 0.42 (0.15) N m\/kg while the ﬂexion moment was 1.16 (0.24) N m\/kg. Similar peak moment values, but different curve proﬁles, were found for the hip. The hip and knee posterio-anterior shear forces and the knee ﬂexion moment were higher during stair climbing than during level walking. The most striking difference between stair ascent and level walking was that the peak patello-femoral contact force was 8 times higher during stair ascent. These data can be used as baseline measures in pathology studies, as input to theoretical joint models, and as input to mechanical joint simulators. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Ledet Ph.D. 1  Abstract— Osteoarthritis is one of the leading causes of chronic pain and disability in the United States. The gold standard to treat osteoarthritis of the knee is to perform a total knee replacement. Post-operatively, as high as 21% of total knee replacement patients experience moderate to severe anterior knee pain. The exact mechanism(s) of anterior knee pain remains unknown. Patellofemoral contact forces are believed to play a significant role in the mechanism of anterior knee pain. Yet, measuring contact forces in the patella has remained a challenge. We have developed a “smart patella” to measure force magnitudes and distributions across the patellofemoral joint. We have designed and conducted proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that our novel force sensing system has the potential to be implanted into the patellofemoral joint space with minimal alterations to modern implant design. Once implanted, our sensors measure in real time, in vivo patellofemoral contact forces.  component sizing, component alignment, ligament release, and passive flexion angle(s). Intuitively, patellar spacer thickness affects load transfer across the patellofemoral joint. In addition, non-optimal spacer size selection can lead to pathologic loading and cause anterior knee pain, but this remains controversial. Patellofemoral biomechanics have been modeled extensively, but due to the size, shape, and articulation of the joint, direct in vivo measurement of forces across the joint have been elusive. We have recently developed a novel implantable force sensor that can be used in conjunction with a standard TKA patellar component to measure forces in vivo, in real time across the patellofemoral joint. The purpose of this work was to develop and test a proof of concept smart patella system.  II. METHODS  A. Sensor Description  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"b9baecb5-7131-42bb-bb51-8daaa7148f64"}

INTRODUCTION  G AIT training (or exercises) using a robotic exoskeleton  can be an appropriate solution for those who need to improve their walking performance due to aging or disease. Hip and ankle assistance, for example, is expected to lessen the problem of excessive use of the hip muscles or a bent posture to compensateforweakeneddistalmusclestrengthandbalance[1], [2]. It is expected that knee assistance can effectively improve a gait rehabilitation and training program in patients who suffer from arthritis [3] or have joint replacements.  To maximize the training effect using an exoskeleton device, interaction force should be applied naturally in accordance with the wearer’s original walking pattern. Because the exoskeleton device’s weight and motion constraints can distort the user’s originalgaitpattern,reducingthedevice’sweightandimproving its wearability should take precedence. The device’s usability, maintenance and manufacturing costs, and ease of wear are also key factors that cannot be overlooked.","id":"0c9122a3-f782-4c71-af92-a4b42fc9ff35"}

The movie also ignores the importance of designing for the wearer’s safety. In Atlas, the suit design unnecessarily complicates emergency medical procedures. During a fight sequence, Lopez is injured and must be removed from the suit to receive medical care, thereby exposing her to attack; ideally, these medical devices would be built into the roomy interior of the suit or incor- porated into the existing points of contact between her body and the suit. The only problem that might be satisfactorily solved is cost, because the military in Atlas appears to be working with an unlimited budget.  In the Atlas universe, roboticists have ap- parently spent those 20 years creating exo- suits that can walk by themselves, although, in reality, an exoskeleton walking with a hu- man inside is the harder problem. Since the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge in 2015, bipedal walking robots have become common. However, in the case of an exo- skeleton, the wearer magnifies the difficulty of self- stabilization; the suit must maintain its balance with a person whose unpredict- able and unmodeled upper body movements ripple across their deformable, fluid body, introducing perturbations into the control system.

Yet, limb joint dynamics do not necessarily reflect muscle dynamics, which dictate whole-body metabolic energy expenditure. Here, we hypothesize that exoskeletons primarily reduce user metabolic energy expenditure across locomotion conditions by reducing active muscle volume. Key Words: energetics, metabolism, augment, locomotion, performance, biomechanics, assistive device  Key Points   Center of mass, limb joint, and muscle mechanical do not explain well how exoskeletons alter locomotion economy.  Limb joint dynamics do not necessarily reflect the underly-  ing muscle dynamics across locomotion conditions.   Active muscles are the primary drivers of whole-body meta- bolic energy expenditure duringlocomotion. Consequently, exoskeletons likely needto consider muscle dynamicstoop- timize locomotion economy.   During walking and hopping with an exoskeleton, muscle force generation is a better correlate to locomotion economy than previously measured mechanical work parameters.  Tracking muscle length changes in vivo may help provide reasonably accurate active muscle volume calculations.  Future exoskeleton controllers may incorporate real-time muscle physiology measures to update device characteristics and maintain minimal active muscle volume and metabolic energy expenditure across locomotion conditions.","id":"1d84fff9-757b-4f69-809f-ada925b3edd7"}

For instance, the most established control method used on powered leg prostheses tracks local joint impedance functions without taking the global function of the leg in balance recovery into account. Here we explore an alternative control policy for powered transfemoral prostheses that considers the global leg function and is based on a neuromuscular model of human locomotion. Methods: We adapt this model to describe and simulate an amputee walking with a powered prosthesis using the proposed control, and evaluate the gait robustness when confronted with rough ground and swing leg disturbances. We then implement and partially evaluate the resulting controller on a leg prosthesis prototype worn by a non-amputee user. Results: In simulation, the proposed prosthesis control leads to more robust walking than the impedance control method. The initial hardware experiments with the prosthesis prototype show that the proposed control reproduces normal walking patterns qualitatively and eﬀectively responds to disturbances in early and late swing. However, the response to mid-swing disturbances neither replicates human responses nor averts falls. Conclusions: The neuromuscular model control is a promising alternative to existing prosthesis controls, although further research will need to improve on the initial implementation and to determine how well these results transfer to amputee gait. Signiﬁcance: This work provides a potential avenue for future development of control policies that help improve amputee balance recovery.  as they cannot generate positive net work over a gait cycle. Consequently, transfemoral amputees wearing these prostheses suﬀer from increased energy consumption, slower ambulation speeds, and a limited ability to respond to unexpected distur- bances such as trips, slips and pushes [3], [4].","id":"b2653ae6-3668-4d68-a224-ae171eaa1984"}

Rouse, and Robert D. Gregg  Abstract—Most impedance-based walking controllers use a ﬁ- nite state machine (FSM) with dozens of user-speciﬁc parameters that need to be manually tuned by technical experts. These parameters are only optimal near the task (e.g., walking speed and incline) at which they were tuned, resulting in decreased per- formance as task inevitably varies. This paper presents a tuning- free, phase-based controller that uses a hybrid combination of continuously-variable impedance control during stance and kine- matic control during swing to enable biomimetic locomotion over a continuum of tasks. After generating a data-driven model of variable joint impedance with convex optimization, we implement a novel task-invariant phase variable and real-time estimates of speed and incline to enable the controller to autonomously adapt to task variation. Experiments with an amputee participant using a powered knee-ankle prosthesis show that our tuning- free controller 1) features highly-linear phase estimates and accurate task estimates, 2) produces more biomimetic joint work trends compared to a hand-tuned FSM impedance controller, and 3) achieves lower kinematic and kinetic error than the FSM impedance controller in 7 of 8 tested metrics.

As a potential way to assist gaits, lower limb ex- oskeletons have been developed. To supply appropriate assistive torque, real-time accurate recognition of current gait mode is important. In this article, a hierarchical con- trol system was proposed to recognize locomotion modes in real time for a unilateral knee exoskeleton on different terrains with speciﬁc assistive control strategies.

The corresponding assistive control strategy was designed according to the recognition result. Real-time recognition experiments under assistive torque control were conducted on ﬁve able-bodied subjects and one stroke patient, respec- tively. For the able-bodied subjects: ﬁrst, no signiﬁcance was found on the total recognition accuracies whichever the leading leg was for the ﬁve subjects (p = 0.057), which indicated the proposed method in this article was suitable whichever the leading leg was as far as the overall classi- ﬁcation accuracy was concerned.

The gold standard to treat osteoarthritis of the knee is to perform a total knee replacement. Post-operatively, as high as 21% of total knee replacement patients experience moderate to severe anterior knee pain. The exact mechanism(s) of anterior knee pain remains unknown. Patellofemoral contact forces are believed to play a significant role in the mechanism of anterior knee pain. Yet, measuring contact forces in the patella has remained a challenge. We have developed a “smart patella” to measure force magnitudes and distributions across the patellofemoral joint. We have designed and conducted proof-of-concept experiments demonstrating that our novel force sensing system has the potential to be implanted into the patellofemoral joint space with minimal alterations to modern implant design. Once implanted, our sensors measure in real time, in vivo patellofemoral contact forces.  component sizing, component alignment, ligament release, and passive flexion angle(s). Intuitively, patellar spacer thickness affects load transfer across the patellofemoral joint. In addition, non-optimal spacer size selection can lead to pathologic loading and cause anterior knee pain, but this remains controversial. Patellofemoral biomechanics have been modeled extensively, but due to the size, shape, and articulation of the joint, direct in vivo measurement of forces across the joint have been elusive. We have recently developed a novel implantable force sensor that can be used in conjunction with a standard TKA patellar component to measure forces in vivo, in real time across the patellofemoral joint. The purpose of this work was to develop and test a proof of concept smart patella system.  II. METHODS  A. Sensor Description  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"b9baecb5-7131-42bb-bb51-8daaa7148f64"}

Legged robot performance would also likely beneﬁt from the co-optimization of actuators and leg morphology. However, development of custom actuators for legged robots is often expensive and time consuming, which discourages roboticists from pursuing performance gains aﬀorded by application-speciﬁc actuator optimization. This paper presents open-source designs for two quasi-direct-drive actuators with performance regimes appropriate for an 8–15 kg robot, built completely with oﬀ the shelf and 3D-printed components for less than $200 USD each. The mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of each actuator are characterized and compared to benchmark data. Actuators subjected to 420k strides of gait data experienced only a 2% reduction in eﬃciency and 26 mrad in backlash growth, demonstrating viability for rigorous and sustained research applications. We present a thermal solution that nearly doubles the thermally-driven torque limits of our plastic actuator design. The performance results are compa- rable to traditional metallic actuators for use in high-speed legged robots of the same scale. These 3D printed designs demonstrate an approach for designing and characterizing low-cost, highly customizable, and highly reproducible actuators, democratizing the ﬁeld of actuator design and enabling co-design and optimization of actuators and robot legs.  1 INTRODUCTION  Bioinspired legged robots have shown impressive agility, terrain traversal ability, and robustness [1, 2, 3, 4].

The multi-disc brake provides resistive torque through a stack of friction discs which are compressed by a dc-motor-driven ball screw. Unlike nearly all other proportional brakes, which operate in a normally unlocked mode, the brake presented here is designed such that it may be configured in either a normally unlocked or normally locked mode. The latter enables lower electrical energy consumption and added safety in the event of electrical power failure in certain applications. Following the device description, experimental data is presented to characterize the performance of the brake. The performance characteristics are subsequently compared to those of a commercially available magnetic particle brake of comparable size. I. INTRODUCTION everal control applications require the use of an electrically controllable proportional rotary brake (e.g., [1]-[16]). Probably the most common and thoroughly developed example of such a device is the magnetic particle brake (MPB). Magnetic particle brakes produce a steady-state resistive torque roughly proportional to the input current. A sectioned view of a magnetic particle brake is shown in Figure 1. DC current applied to the brake coil induces a magnetic field which links fine ferrite particles to the rotating brake shaft. The amount of current in the coil determines the strength of the magnetic field, which in turn determines the resistive torque imposed on the brake shaft. Compared with the closed-loop control of a high-performance DC torque motor, these devices provide a relatively low-power and light-weight means of exerting controlled dissipative mechanical torque. Further, using an electric motor as a dissipater requires measurement of velocity, which typically contains phase lag, which in turn adds (rather than dissipates) energy to the system. A proportional brake, on the other hand, does not require velocity measurement and is guaranteed to be energetically passive. Though the weight of a magnetic particle brake is low relative to a DC motor (for a given resistive torque), in many cases the weight remains significant","id":"609e9e09-a714-4fc1-bece-941ab5dbeefd"}

The following research discusses the posthuman subject in contemporary times, focusing on prosthetic applications to deliberate how the disabled body is empowered through prosthetic enhancement and cultural representations. The disability market both intersects and transcends race, religion, and gender; the promise of technology bettering the human condition is its ultimate product. Bionic technology, in particular, is a burgeoning ﬁeld; our engineering skills already show promise of a future where physical impediment will be almost obsolete. I aim to cross-examine empowering marketing images and phrases embedded in cinema and media that emphasize how disability becomes super-ability with prosthetic enhancement. Though the beneﬁts of biotechnology are most empowering to the disabled population, further scrutiny raises a number of paradoxical questions exposed by the market’s advance. With all these tools at our disposal, why is it that the disabled have yet to reap the rewards? How are disabled bodies, biotechnology, and posthuman possibilities commodiﬁed and commercialized? Most importantly, what impact will this have on our society? This paper exempliﬁes empowering and inclusive messages emphasized in disabled representation, as well as raising bioethical concerns that fuel the ongoing debate of the technological haves and have-nots. Furthermore, this paper challenges the ideals of normative bodies while depicting the disabledasanopen, embodiedsitewheretechnology, corporeality, andsociologyinteract. Toconclude, I believe that an interdisciplinary approach that balances the debate between scientiﬁc advance, capital gain, and social equality is essential to embracing diverse forms of embodiment.

I‑Chieh Lee1*  , Bretta L. Fylstra1, Ming Liu1, Tommaso Lenzi2 and He Huang1  Abstract Background: Energy cost minimization has been widely accepted to regulate gait. Optimization principles have been frequently used to explain how individuals adapt their gait pattern. However, there have been rare attempts to account for the role of variability in this optimization process. Motor redundancy can enable individuals to perform tasks reliably while achieving energy optimization. However, we do not know how the non‑goal‑equivalent and goal‑ equivalent variability is regulated. In this study, we investigated how unilateral transfemoral amputees regulate step and stride variability based on the task to achieve energy economy.  Methods: Nine individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputation walked on a treadmill at speeds of 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2 and 1.4 m\/s using their prescribed passive prostheses. We calculated the step‑to‑step and stride‑to‑stride variability and applied goal equivalent manifold (GEM) based control to decompose goal‑equivalent and non‑goal‑equivalent manifold. To quantify the energy economy, the energy recovery rate (R) was calculated based on potential energy and kinetic energy. Comparisons were made between GEM variabilities and commonly used standard deviation measure‑ ments. A linear regression model was used to investigate the trade‑off between R and GEM variabilities.  Results: Our analysis shows greater variability along the goal‑equivalent manifold compared to the non‑goal‑ equivalent manifold (p < 0.001). Moreover, our analysis shows lower energy recovery rate for amputee gait compared to nonamputee gait (at least 20% less at faster walking speed). We found a negative relationship between energy recovery rate and non‑goal‑equivalent variability. Compared to the standard deviation measurements, the variability decomposed using GEM reflected the preferred walking speed and the limitation of the passive prosthetic device.","id":"8d51c9d8-b604-47f5-a718-baca25209ba3"}

Patient preference, a formalized representation of “what patients want”, provides an efficient method for identifying appropriate prosthesis mechanics. Unfortunately, a lack of the scientific and technological tools necessary to formally measure and rigorously understand preference has led to limitations in ascertaining its role in the prescription process. In this study, our objective was to understand how preference changes with walking speed and how preference corresponds to clinical metrics of gait performance. We characterized preferred stiffness of the Variable Stiffness Prosthetic Ankle Foot (VSPA Foot) across speeds in persons with below knee amputation. We then assessed metabolic expenditure and performance in the ten-meter walk test at several stiffness values around the preferred stiffness. Preferred stiffness did not correlate with body mass, and was lower at the self-selected treadmill walking speed than at either the fast or slow speeds. There was a significant increase in self-selected overground speed in the ten meter walk test at stiffness values at or above the preferred stiffness. Changes to prosthetic ankle stiffness within +\/- 30% of the preferred stiffness did not significantly affect metabolic expenditure. These results indicate that preferred stiffness may be associated with significant changes in self-selected overground walking speed (p < 0.001), and may not be driven by metabolic optimality (p > 0.93). This outcome motivates future work to identify other potential drivers of preference, including biomechanical correlates of gait, and highlights the potential value of formally incorporating patient preference into the clinical prescription process. I. INTRODUCTION The current prescription paradigm for commercial lower-extremity prostheses is hampered by a lack of robust metrics to identify optimal clinical solutions. In parallel with shaping a socket, prosthetists work with patients to select appropriate prosthetic componentry. Experience, including trial-and-error methodologies, play a substantial role in selecting and adjusting these components. In a typical clinical session, the prosthetist observes the patient’s gait and looks for several indicators of fit and function. Based on these observations, the prosthetist may choose to make adjustments, or may try new component selections [1], [2]","id":"123bc333-3043-4812-9d58-a64edb2cf8ac"}

We therefore quantified the effect of five different outdoor terrains on foot  19  motion (from IMUs) and net metabolic rate (from oxygen consumption) in healthy adults (N = 10;  20  walking at 1.25 m\/s).

A biomechanical comparison of back and front squats in healthy trained individuals. J Strength Cond Res 23(1): 284–292, 2008—The strength and stability of the knee plays an integral role in athletics and activities of daily living. A better under- standing of knee joint biomechanics while performing variations in rehabilitation and exercise of the squat would be useful prescription. We quantiﬁed and compared tibiofemoral joint kinetics as well as muscle activity while executing front and back squats. Because of the inherent change in the position of the center of mass of the bar between the front and back squat lifts, we hypothesized that the back squat would result in increased loads on the knee joint and that the front squat would result in increased knee extensor and decreased back extensor muscle activity. A crossover study design was used. To assess the net force and torque placed on the knee and muscle activation levels, a combination of video and force data, as well as surface electromyographic data, were collected from 15 healthy trained individuals. The back squat resulted in signiﬁcantly higher compressive forces and knee extensor moments than the front squat. Shear forces at the knee were in magnitude, posteriorly directed, and did not vary small between the squat variations. Although bar position did not inﬂuence muscle activity, muscle activation during the ascending phase was signiﬁcantly greater than during the descending phase. The front squat was as effective as the back squat in terms of overall muscle recruitment, with signiﬁcantly less com- pressive forces and extensor moments. The results suggest that front squats may be advantageous compared with back squats for individuals with knee problems such as meniscus tears, and for long-term joint health.

To identify the correct timing of giving assistive torques during the stair climbing process, integrating with a lower limb dynamic model with the foot-force measured data is a common way to derive the knee joint torque profile for gait analysis. However, this estimation method which requires the installation of pressure sensors on the sole of the feet has drawbacks including the inconvenience of exoskeleton wearing and increased moving difficulty. The fact that stair climbing is a sequential movement thus allows us to apply a recurrent neural network to obtain the relationship between the knee joint muscular torque and lower limb gait. Stair climbing experiments on a knee exoskeleton wearer reveal that the trained neural network is able to perform the desired knee joint torque estimation whose results can be applied to derive proper assistive torques in the presence of human-robot interaction.","id":"8dfa97e9-f028-4a1a-9c5a-e65c8308972f"}

However, passive prosthetic knees are not able to provide high levels of resistance at the end of the sit-down movement when the knee is \u0000exed and users need the most support. Consequently, users are forced  to over-compensate with their upper body, residual hip, and intact leg, and\/or sit down with a ballistic and uncontrolled movement. Powered prostheses have the potential to solve this problem by controlling the joints using motors, which can produce higher levels of resistance at a larger range of joint positions than  passive damper systems. Therefore, powered prostheses have the potential to make sitting down more controlled and less di\u0000cult for above-knee amputees, improving their functional mobility.  Methods: Ten individuals with above-knee amputations sat down using their prescribed passive prosthesis and a research powered knee-ankle prosthesis.

Nuckols, Krithika Swaminathan, Sangjun Lee, Dheepak Arumukhom Revi, Conor J. Walsh, and Robert D. Howe  Paulson School of Engineering and the Wyss Institute at Harvard, MA, USA.  Abstract—Wearable robotic devices (exosuits, exoskeletons) for augmenting gait can reduce group level metabolic demand. However, at the individual level, metabolic response is variable and the mechanisms behind this inconsistency is unclear. In this work, our aim is to investigate the effect of muscle tendon dynamics on individual response to exosuit assistance. To this end, we measured muscle contraction state of the soleus and medial gastrocnemius using B-mode ultrasound while naïve subjects walked with exosuit assistance. We also sub-categorized subjects into good and poor responders. We found that subjects that responded well (15% reduction) to the assistance began soleus muscle contraction prior to the onset of assistance. Conversely, the soleus muscle contraction began after the onset of assistance in subjects that responded poorly (2% reduction). We also found that the medial gastrocnemius was lengthening at the time of assistance onset in subjects that responded poorly which may highlight the impact of knee mechanics. These findings suggest the importance of energy exchange between the muscle, tendon, joint and environment towards efficient walking and how exosuit assistance might affect those dynamics. Ongoing and future work will expand upon this work and will incorporate EMG, kinematic, and kinetic analysis.  Our aim in this work is to evaluate whether muscle contraction dynamics of the triceps surae can help explain individual response to ankle exosuit assistance. The efficiency of walking is heavily reliant upon proper function of the ankle joint and the muscle-tendon unit (MTU). Efficient and powerful ankle plantarflexion is generated only through properly timed energy exchange between the muscle, the series elastic tendon, the joint, body, and environment. Therefore, understanding and maintaining effective MTU dynamics is also crucial for efficient walking. We suggest that ultrasound-based measurement of muscle dynamics can provide for understanding exosuit performance compared to kinematic, kinetic, and EMG-based measurements. We hypothesize that initial response to exosuit assistance will be predicted by similarity between baseline muscle contraction timing and the onset timing of exosuit assistance.  improved metrics  II.

In humans, a large portion of the mechanical work required for walking comes from muscle-tendons crossing the ankle joint. Elastic energy storage and return in the Achilles tendon during each step enhance the efficiency of ankle muscle-tendon mechanical work far beyond what is possible for work performed by knee and hip joint muscle-tendons. Key Words: gait, locomotion, walking, energetics, exoskeleton, efficiency  INTRODUCTION  Human walking mechanics have long been described using an inverted pendulum analogy (5). The body center of mass travels in an arc trajectory such that it rises and decelerates during the first half of stance, and lowers and accelerates during the second half of stance, similar to an inverted pendulum. By coupling a regular pendulum to an inverted pendulum to make a swing leg and a stance leg, a simple passive model can reproduce the basic movement and energy patterns of human walking (15,20). Despite their simplicity, passive pendular models make a number of key predictions about the energetics of bipedal walking. First, energy can be conserved by exchanging kinetic and gravita- tional potential energy during the stance phase of each step. Second, leg swing can be purely passive under certain initial conditions. Third, the major source of energy loss during walking is the step-to-step transition (16). At this time, the center of mass must be redirected from moving downward and forward to moving upward and forward. This redirection requires mechanical work to maintain steady speed walking dynamics (16).  Simple models also provide insight into how the mechan- ical energy lost in the foot-ground collision is replaced by positive mechanical work performed by the legs. One way to perform the work is to generate an impulsive push-off along the trailing limb just before the leading limb collides with  the ground. An alternative way to power level walking in the model is to use active hip torque (15). Either of these methods could be done solely with active power production or by supplementing active power production with recovered energy that was previously stored in elastic elements.","id":"49539129-b874-4998-8289-f477ad875f74"}

The device is comprised of a high-pressure air tank, a pilot-operated valve, and a nozzle, which are employed together to create a thrust intended to correct a state of imbalance. The authors first employed modeling and simulation of the thruster-based system to assess feasibility of such a device, and based on these results designed and constructed a device prototype. The prototype was then tested on a rocking block that was used as an experimental model of a standing human subject. Experiments were conducted to assess the angular response of the rocking block starting from various initial tilt angles, both with and without the use of the cold gas thruster. For the experiments with the thruster, the valve was energized at the moment of release, thereby activating the cold-gas thruster, the thrust of which was directed to oppose the “fall.” A comparison between the two cases indicates that the fall prevention prototype increased the region of block stability by more than a factor of three (from a tilt angle of approximately 7 to 26 deg). I. INTRODUCTION Falls in elderly people are a well-known cause of injury. One in four people over the age of 65 fall every year costing an estimated $31.3 billion to Medicare annually [1]. As people age, their balance declines due to several physiological changes. In particular, balance depends on visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and musculoskeletal systems, all of which are subject to become compromised as age advances [2]. Falls can lead to severe injuries, fear of falling, loss of independence and death [3]. The majority of fall prevention research has focused on in-home strategies for preventing falls, such as handrails, higher friction flooring, and improved lighting. However, an epidemiological study of falls in older community-dwellings showed that 62% of falls occur while outside of the home [4]. A significant unmet need exists for a device to prevent falls outside of the home without a large impact on the user’s lifestyle. The recent emergence of wearable devices may offer promise to aid fall prevention. At this point, relatively little research exists on the use of wearable devices for fall prevention","id":"e83f15b1-553d-4c02-a809-9a93f18619f1"}

Lerner  Abstract—Most people with cerebral palsy (CP) suffer from impaired walking ability and pathological gait pat- terns. Seeking to improve the effectiveness of gait train- ing in this patient population, this study developed and assessed the feasibility of a real-time biofeedback mech- anism to augment untethered ankle exoskeleton-assisted walking performance in individuals with CP. We selected step length as a clinically-relevant gait performance target and utilized a visual interface with live performance scores. An adaptive ankle exoskeleton control algorithm provided assistance proportional to the real-time ankle moment. We assessed lower-extremity gait mechanics and muscle activity in seven ambulatory individuals with CP as they walked with adaptive ankle assistance alone and with ankle assistance plus step-length biofeedback. We achieved our technical validation goal by demonstrating a strong corre- lation between estimated step length and real step length (R = 0.771, p < 0.001). We achieved our clinical feasibil- ity goal by demonstrating that biofeedback-plus-assistance resulted in a 14% increase in step length relative to baseline (p ≤ 0.05), while no difference in step length was observed for assistance alone. Additionally, we observed near imme- diate improvements in lower-extremity posture, moments, and positive power relative to baseline for biofeedback- plus-assistance (p < 0.05), with none, or more-limited improvements observed for assistance alone. Our ﬁndings suggestthatprovidingreal-timebiofeedbackandusingstep length as the target can be effective for increasing the rate at which individuals with CP improve their gait mechanics when walking with wearable ankle assistance.  I. INTRODUCTION  INDIVIDUALS with cerebral palsy (CP) experience move-  ment and posture impairment that negatively affects their mobility and physical activity levels [1], [2]. They often exhibit pathological gait patterns that can involve excessive knee and hip ﬂexion during stance and reduced ankle plantarﬂexion prior to push-off. These gait patterns are associated with slow walking speed, reduced step length and increased energy cost of transport [3]–[5]. Many children with CP experience a steady decline in mobility across their lifespan [6].","id":"a233c1c2-2627-44f8-a661-598c9ae35f8e"}

Based on the human-robot interaction force information, a PID control algorithm is applied to realize the passive following control of the swing phase. Aiming at the requirements of the active assist of the support phase on the joint angle and the size of the assist, a composite control method with PID control as the outer loop and sliding mode control as the inner loop is proposed. In order to solve the sliding mode vibration problem, the equivalent sliding mode control algorithm is used, and the sign function in it is replaced by the saturation function. On this basis, the experimental system was built and the experimental study was completed, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption during the human weight-bearing staircase.

The use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) in joint moment estimation has drawn considerable attention. Minimizing the number of IMUs deployed on the lower-limb and simplifying the application procedure have long been the pressing problem to be solved during the accurate estimation of multiple joint moments in multiple scenarios. In the present study, the performance of seven different deep-learning models, including the proposed attention-based conventional neural network- bidirectional long short-term memory model and six previous-published typical deep-learning models, were compared in predicting the sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle joint moments during the most representative locomotive activities. A public dataset was employed to train and validate these models. Seven configurations of IMUs, including different placement and number of IMUs, were evaluated to explore the influence of IMU setup on the performance of the proposed model. Of all seven deep-learning models, best performance was achieved using the proposed model. Pearson correlation coefficient derived from the proposed model using a single IMU attached on the shank, foot, and thigh reached up to 0.85, 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. Shank is the optimal location for attaching a single IMU for the moment prediction of all three joints, while extra IMUs attached elsewhere failed to derive pronounced benefit for improving the estimation accuracy. Thus, even using a single shank-worn IMU, the proposed model is still capable of accurately estimating the joint moments of lower-limbs.  1. Introduction","id":"7a59cb75-71bb-4049-9107-e5fec6c90ef5"}

Ferris University of Florida  The authors tested 4 young healthy subjects walking with a powered knee exoskeleton to determine if it could reduce the metabolic cost of locomotion. Subjects walked with a backpack loaded and unloaded, on a treadmill with inclinations of 0° and 15°, and outdoors with varied natural terrain. Participants walked at a self-selected speed (average 1.0 m\/s) for all conditions, except incline treadmill walking (average 0.5 m\/s). The authors hypothesized that the knee exoskeleton would reduce the metabolic cost of walking uphill and with a load compared with walking without the exoskeleton. The knee exoskeleton reduced metabolic cost by 4.2% in the 15° incline with the backpack load. All other conditions had an increase in metabolic cost when using the knee exoskeleton compared with not using the exoskeleton. There was more variation in metabolic cost over the outdoor walking course with the knee exoskeleton than without it. Our ﬁndings indicate that powered assistance at the knee is more likely to decrease the metabolic cost of walking in uphill conditions and during loaded walking rather than in level conditions without a backpack load. Differences in positive mechanical work demand at the knee for varying conditions may explain the differences in metabolic beneﬁt from the exoskeleton.

For instance, the most established control method used on powered leg prostheses tracks local joint impedance functions without taking the global function of the leg in balance recovery into account. Here we explore an alternative control policy for powered transfemoral prostheses that considers the global leg function and is based on a neuromuscular model of human locomotion. Methods: We adapt this model to describe and simulate an amputee walking with a powered prosthesis using the proposed control, and evaluate the gait robustness when confronted with rough ground and swing leg disturbances. We then implement and partially evaluate the resulting controller on a leg prosthesis prototype worn by a non-amputee user. Results: In simulation, the proposed prosthesis control leads to more robust walking than the impedance control method. The initial hardware experiments with the prosthesis prototype show that the proposed control reproduces normal walking patterns qualitatively and eﬀectively responds to disturbances in early and late swing. However, the response to mid-swing disturbances neither replicates human responses nor averts falls. Conclusions: The neuromuscular model control is a promising alternative to existing prosthesis controls, although further research will need to improve on the initial implementation and to determine how well these results transfer to amputee gait. Signiﬁcance: This work provides a potential avenue for future development of control policies that help improve amputee balance recovery.  as they cannot generate positive net work over a gait cycle. Consequently, transfemoral amputees wearing these prostheses suﬀer from increased energy consumption, slower ambulation speeds, and a limited ability to respond to unexpected distur- bances such as trips, slips and pushes [3], [4].","id":"b2653ae6-3668-4d68-a224-ae171eaa1984"}

Traditional rigid exoskeletons can be challenging to perfectly align with a wearer’s biological joints and can have large inertias, which can lead to the wearer altering their natural motion patterns. Exosuits, in comparison, use textiles to create tensile forces over the body in parallel with the muscles, enabling them to be light and not restrict the wearer’s kinematics. We de- scribe the biologically inspired design and function of our exosuit, including a simpliﬁed model of the suit’s archi- tecture and its interaction with the body. A key feature of the exosuit is that it can generate forces passively due to the body’s motion, similar to the body’s ligaments and tendons.

To realize steady walk on stairs, the most important problem is the structure design and gait planning of lower limb exoskeleton. A novel assisted exoskeleton system was proposed based on biomechanics characteristics. The four-point segmented gait generation strategy based on cubic spline interpolation was proposed, and the gait trajectory during stair walking was described. To ensure walking stability, the constraint relationship between the swing leg and the stair step was constructed. In addition, the constraint function was constructed for stable walking in horizontal and vertical directions based on zero moment point (ZMP). Then, the multicoupled continuous dynamic primitive gait learning strategy (PIRDMPs) was proposed to achieve fine-grained learning of stair gait trajectories. Finally, the proposed method was validated by human–machine wear experiments. Compared with the dynamic motion primitive (DMP) method, the average trajectory fits for the hip and knee joints obtained based on the PIRDMPs method were increased by 11.28% and 7.17%, respectively. Also, the average deviation values of ZMP in the sagittal plane (ZMP-X) and coronal plane (ZMP-Y) of the man–machine system were reduced by 109.2 and 125.3 mm, respectively.

Rouse  1,4,5 ✉  Joint mechanical impedance, which describes the instantaneous relationship between kinematic perturbations and the resulting torque response, plays an important role in the way humans ambulate, interact with the environment, and respond to disturbances. Recent studies have quantified how the stiffness component of mechanical impedance varies during walking. However, the extent to which humans can voluntarily regulate leg joint stiffness is not yet known. Our study sought to quantify the accuracy and precision of the neuromotor system to voluntarily regulate ankle joint stiffness while seated, and compare these data to the well-known abilities to regulate ankle joint torque and position. We tested individuals’ ability to to regulate these quantities at three different magnitudes: 20%, 40%, and 60% of a maximum value. Our results showed that subjects were able to voluntarily regulate ankle joint stiffness, and that the normalized accuracy and precision of stiffness regulation were not different than those of position or torque for targets at magnitudes of 20% of a maximum value. However, the accuracy and precision of stiffness regulation were statistically different than those of position and torque for targets at magnitudes of 40% of the maximum values. At moderate targets, the similarity of the ability to regulate ankle joint stiffness when compared to the abilities to regulate joint torque and position highlights the importance of a comprehensive description of lower-limb biomechanics that includes consideration of joint mechanical impedance, in addition to the common descriptions of joint torque and position.  Our fundamental understanding of how human locomotion is regulated by the neuromuscular system mainly stems from analyses of how the legs are moved during gait (joint angles), and how effort is provided throughout locomotion (joint torques)1.

In this study, a knee exoskeleton rehabilitation robot driven by a quasi-direct driver actuator is designed. The torque generation model is constructed based on the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network, and the knee joint torque is generated by sEMG and angle signal. A joint attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of torque generation model. The impedance control parameters are adaptively adjusted in accordance with the joint torque. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-LSTM hybrid neural network is capable of effectively estimating torque, the mean MAE and CC of the proposed model are 1.141Nm and 93.7%, respectively. The optimized impedance control can optimize the initial value of the impedance parameter, which reduced the torque error by 5.54% and 50.64% at uphill tasks and walking task, respectively, and adaptively adjust the impedance parameter to ensure the coordination of the gait rehabilitation and the friendly human- robot interaction.

Sawicki∗ and Nabil S. Khan  Abstract—Goal: A recent experiment demonstrated that when humans wear unpowered elastic ankle exoskeletons with inter- mediate spring stiffness, they can reduce their metabolic energy cost to walk by ∼7%. Springs that are too compliant or too stiff have little beneﬁt. The purpose of this study was to use model- ing and simulation to explore the muscle-level mechanisms for the “sweet spot” in stiffness during exoskeleton assisted walking. Methods: We developed a simple lumped uniarticular muscu- loskeletal model of the plantarﬂexors operating in parallel with an elastic “exo-tendon.” Using an inverse approach with constrained kinematics and kinetics, we rapidly simulated human walking over a range of exoskeleton stiffness values and examined the underly- ing neuromechanics and energetics of the biological plantarﬂexors. Results: Stiffer ankle exoskeleton springs resulted in larger de- creases in plantarﬂexor muscle forces, activations, and metabolic energyconsumption.However,intheprocessofunloadingthecom- pliant biological muscle–tendon unit, the muscle fascicles expe- rienced larger excursions that negatively impacted series elastic element recoil that is characteristic of a tuned “catapult mecha- nism.” Conclusion: The combination of disrupted muscle–tendon dynamics and the need to produce compensatory forces\/moments to maintain overall net ankle moment invariance could explain the “sweet spot” in metabolic performance at intermediate ankle exoskeleton stiffness. Future work will aim to provide experimen- tal evidence to support the model predictions presented here us- ing ultrasound imaging of muscle-level dynamics during walking with elastic ankle exoskeletons. Signiﬁcance: Engineers must ac- count for the muscle-level effects of exoskeleton designs in order to achieve maximal performance objectives.","id":"278f2052-1ea0-4d0a-a2d5-c1da4ee852cd"}

L. Philip Chen , Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—A novel neuro-fuzzy model named fuzzy broad learning system (BLS) is proposed by merging the Takagi–Sugeno (TS) fuzzy system into BLS. The fuzzy BLS replaces the feature nodes of BLS with a group of TS fuzzy subsystems, and the input data are processed by each of them. Instead of aggregating the outputs of fuzzy rules produced by every fuzzy subsystem into one value immediately, all of them are sent to the enhance- ment layer for further nonlinear transformation to preserve the characteristic of inputs. The defuzziﬁcation outputs of all fuzzy subsystem and the outputs of enhancement layer are combined together to obtain the model output. The k-means method is employed to determine the centers of Gaussian membership func- tions in antecedent part and the number of fuzzy rules. The parameters that need to be calculated in a fuzzy BLS are the weights connecting the outputs of enhancement layer to model output and the randomly initialized coefﬁcients of polynomials in consequent part in fuzzy subsystems, which can be calculated analytically. Therefore, fuzzy BLS retains the fast computational nature of BLS. The proposed fuzzy BLS is evaluated by some pop- ular benchmarks for regression and classiﬁcation, and compared with some state-of-the-art nonfuzzy and neuro-fuzzy approaches. The results indicate that fuzzy BLS outperforms other models involved. Moreover, fuzzy BLS shows advantages over neuro- fuzzy models regarding to the number of fuzzy rules and training time, which can ease the problem of rule explosion to some extent.  I. INTRODUCTION  THE COMBINATION of human-like reasoning style based  on a set of IF-THEN fuzzy rules of fuzzy system with the learning and connecting structure of neural network (NN) leads to a hybrid system which is widely termed as fuzzy NN or neuro-fuzzy model in the literature.","id":"ff49222c-c1d5-4356-8a35-a01ce5ca3771"}

First published October 11, 2012; doi:10.1152\/japplphysiol.00802.2012.—The springlike mechanics of the human leg during bouncing gaits has inspired the design of passive assistive devices that use springs to aid locomotion. The purpose of this study was to test whether a passive spring-loaded ankle exoskeleton could reduce the mechanical and energetic demands of bilateral hopping on the musculoskeletal sys- tem. Joint level kinematics and kinetics were collected with electro- myographic and metabolic energy consumption data for seven partic- ipants hopping at four frequencies (2.2, 2.5, 2.8, and 3.2 Hz). Hopping was performed without an exoskeleton; with an springless exoskele- ton; and with a spring-loaded exoskeleton. Spring-loaded ankle exo- skeletons reduced plantar ﬂexor muscle activity and the biological contribution to ankle joint moment (15–25%) and average positive power (20–40%). They also facilitated reductions in metabolic power (15–20%) across frequencies from 2.2 to 2.8 Hz compared with hopping with a springless exoskeleton. Reductions in metabolic power compared with hopping with no exoskeleton were restricted to hop- ping at 2.5 Hz only (12%). These results highlighted the importance of reducing the rate of muscular force production and work to achieve metabolic reductions. They also highlighted the importance of assist- ing muscles acting at the knee joint. Exoskeleton designs may need to be tuned to optimize exoskeleton mass, spring stiffness, and spring slack length to achieve greater metabolic reductions.","id":"dc88c203-1c92-4f80-8618-3d5f7a21c993"}

State-of-the-art decoders demand ex- tensive training, require data from a large number of EMG sensors, and are prone to poor predictions. Biomechanical models of a sin- gle movement degree-of-freedom tell us that relatively few muscles, and hence fewer EMG sensors, are needed to predict movement. We propose a novel decoder based on a dynamic, functional linear model with velocity or acceleration as its response and the recent past EMG signals as functional covariates. The eﬀect of each EMG signal varies with the recent position to account for biomechanical features of hand movement, increasing the predictive capability of a single EMG sig- nal compared to existing decoders. The eﬀects are estimated with a multi-stage, adaptive estimation procedure we call Sequential Adap- tive Functional Estimation (SAFE). Starting with 16 potential EMG sensors, our method correctly identiﬁes the few EMG signals that are known to be important for an able-bodied subject. Furthermore, the estimated eﬀects are interpretable and can signiﬁcantly improve understanding and development of robotic hand prostheses.  1. Introduction. Over 160,000 Americans are transradial (i.e. below- elbow) amputees, henceforth TRAs, and must learn how to perform tasks without their intact hand (Ziegler-Graham et al., 2008). Passive hand pros- theses are useful but cannot fully emulate the functionality of an intact hand.

Ishmael, Minh Tran, Student Member, IEEE, and Tommaso Lenzi, Member, IEEE    Abstract In this paper, we explore the effect of residual hip assistance in one above-knee amputee subject using a novel lightweight powered hip exoskeleton. Differently from a powered prosthesis, a powered hip exoskeleton adds mass proximally. Thus, we expect that the negative effect of the added mass will be lower for a powered hip exoskeleton than a powered ankle and knee prosthesis. Consequently, residual-hip assistance may more easily lead to a net reduction of metabolic effort. To preliminarily assess this hypothesis, we measured the physiological cost index (PCI) while an above-knee subject walked with and without a powered hip exoskeleton. Experimental results show 20.5% reduction of PCI when walking with the powered hip exoskeleton. I. INTRODUCTION  the performance and reduce the mass of powered prostheses.

Tree-based BLS (TBLS) is designed for small data modeling by introducing nondifferentiable modules and an ensemble strategy to the traditional broad learning system (BLS). TBLS replaces the neurons of BLS with the tree modules to map the input data. Moreover, we present three new TBLS variant methods and their incremental learning implementations, which are motivated by deep, broad, and ensemble learning. Their major distinction is reﬂected in the incremental learning strategies based on: 1) mean square error (mse); 2) pseudo- inverse; and 3) pseudo-inverse theory and stack representation. Therefore, this study further explores the domain of BLS based on the nondifferentiable modules. The simulations are compared with some state-of-the-art (SOTA) BLS-NN and tree methods under high-, medium-, and low-dimensional benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the BLS-NN, and the modeling accuracy is remarkably improved with the small training data of the proposed TBLS.

Adam Quirk1,3, Jason M. Cherin1, Dennis Friedrich1, Daekyum Kim1,2 & Conor J. Walsh1  Back exoskeletons are gaining attention for preventing occupational back injuries, but they can disrupt movement, a burden that risks abandonment. Enhanced adaptability is proposed to mitigate burdens, but perceptual benefits are less known. This study investigates the perceptual and biomechanical impacts of a SLACK suit (non-assistive) controller versus three controllers with varying adaptability: a Weight-Direction-Angle adaptive (WDA-ADPT) that scales assistance based on the weight of the boxes using a chest-mounted camera and machine learning algorithm, movement direction, and trunk flexion angle, and standard Direction-Angle adaptive (DA-ADPT) and Angle adaptive (A-ADPT) controllers. Fifteen participants performed a variable weight (2, 8, 14 kg) box-transfer task. WDA-ADPT achieved the highest perceptual score (88%) across survey categories and reduced peak back extensor (BE) muscle amplitudes by 10.1%. DA-ADPT had slightly lower perceptual (76%) and peak BE reduction (8.5%). A-ADPT induced hip restriction, which could explain the lowest perceptual score (55%) despite providing the largest reductions in peak BE muscle activity (17.3%). Reduced perceptual scores achieved by DA and A-ADPT were explained by controllers providing too much or little assistance versus actual task demands. These findings underscore that scaling assistance to task demands improves biomechanical benefits and the perception of the device’s suitability.  Back exos, including exoskeletons and exosuits, have been developed to reduce the risk of occupational low back injuries (LBI)1posed by tasks with high peak and cumulative lumbar moments2–4. Engineering controls designed to reduce lumbar moments, such as adjusting table height and installing electric hoists, have demonstrated reductions in LBI rates5. Given that back exos effectively reduce back extensor (BE) moments and muscle activity1, they could mitigate the risk of developing occupational LBIs6,7. However, devices must have a high intention to maximize this potential8.","id":"55c31e5b-8329-422e-9a3c-81b06a3435ce"}

L. Philip Chen , Fellow, IEEE  Abstract—The broad learning system (BLS) paradigm has recently emerged as a computationally efﬁcient approach to supervised learning. Its efﬁciency arises from a learning mecha- nism based on the method of least-squares. However, the need for storing and inverting large matrices can put the efﬁciency of such mechanism at risk in big-data scenarios. In this work, we propose a new implementation of BLS in which the need for storing and inverting large matrices is avoided. The distinguishing features of the designed learning mechanism are as follows: 1) the training process can balance between efﬁcient usage of memory and required iterations (hybrid recursive learning) and 2) retraining is avoided when the network is expanded (incremental learning). It is shown that, while the proposed framework is equivalent to the standard BLS in terms of trained network weights,much larger networks than the standard BLS can be smoothly trained by the proposed solution, projecting BLS toward the big-data frontier.

A. Background on Broad Learning System  The broad learning system (BLS) paradigm has recently emerged as a supervised learning method in which the hypoth- esis is improved by expanding the network in width rather than depth. Reasons behind the study of BLS come from some recognized issues of deep structures, such as overcoming the need for gradient-descent training that might make learning slow [19]–[21], preventing complete retraining when new hypotheses must be formulated [22]–[24], and avoiding huge processing power, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) that are typically needed in deep structures [25].

Lerner  Abstract—The high energy cost of walking in individuals with cerebralpalsy (CP) contributessigniﬁcantlyto reduced mobility and quality of life. The purpose of this paper was to develop and clinically evaluate an untethered ankle exoskeleton with the ability to reduce the metabolic cost of walking in children and young adults with gait pathology from CP. We designed a battery-powered device consisting of an actuator-and-control module worn above the waist with a Bowden cable transmission used to provide torque to pulleys aligned with the ankle. Special consideration was made to minimize adding mass to the body, particu- larly distal portions of the lower-extremity. The exoskeleton provided plantar-ﬂexor assistance during the mid-to-late stance phase, controlledusing a real-time control algorithm and embedded sensors. We conducted a device feasibility and a pilot clinical evaluation study with ﬁve individuals with CP ages ﬁve through thirty years old. Participants completed an average of 130 min of exoskeleton-assisted walking practice. We observed a 19 ± 5% improvement in the metabolic cost of transport (p = 0.011) during walking with untethered exoskeleton assistance compared to how participants walked normally.

Wearable technologies can be used to help monitor a patients progress in and adherence to their rehabilitation pro- tocols. Further, estimating joint angles can help medical professionals treat their patients effectively. In this paper, we propose three models that can be used in succession to calculate knee angles from voltage. These models take an input of voltage, calculate the resistance of our conductive fabric sensor, then calculate the change in length across the front of the knee and ﬁnally to the angle of the knee. We present TracKnee, a sensing knee sleeve designed and fabricated to unobtrusively measure knee angles. We evaluated our model and our device by conducting a user with six participants where we collected 240 ground truth angles and sensor data from our TracKnee device. Our results show that our model is 94.86% accurate to the nearest 15th degree angle and that our average error per angle is 3.69\u0000.  Keywords: Healthcare, Wearable Technology, E-textiles  1. Introduction  Knee injuries are prevalent among all demographics of the population and the treatment of these injuries can be costly in recovery time and monetarily[1]. From 1999 to 2011, a study of more than 6.5 million knee injuries in the United States revealed that nearly 50% of the knee injuries were sports related with adolescents making up an estimated 2.5 million sports related knee injuries annually [2]. In the senior population, knee injuries are common due to falling and diseases such as osteoarthritis. More than 14 million individuals suffered from osteoarthritis of the knee is 2007 and 2008 in the United States[3]. Whether old or young and regardless of injury, a patients’ recovery from their knee injury is based on their adherence to their assigned rehabilitation protocols[4][5].","id":"dd64d7c9-e49c-4c9e-b341-4539c6f3e098"}

Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—We present the design of a powered knee-ankle prosthetic leg, which implements high-torque actuators with low-reduction transmissions. The transmission coupled with a high-torque and low-speed motor creates an actuator with low mechanical impedance and high backdrivability. This style of actuation presents several possible beneﬁts over modern actuation styles in emerging robotic prosthetic legs, which include free- swinging knee motion, compliance with the ground, negligible unmodeled actuator dynamics, less acoustic noise, and power regeneration. Benchtop tests establish that both joints can be backdriven by small torques (∼1-3 Nm) and conﬁrm the small reﬂected inertia. Impedance control tests prove that the intrinsic impedance and unmodeled dynamics of the actuator are sufﬁciently small to control joint impedance without torque feedback or lengthy tuning trials. Walking experiments validate performance under the designed loading conditions with minimal tuning. Lastly, the regenerative abilities, low friction, and small reﬂected inertia of the presented actuators reduced power con- sumption and acoustic noise compared to state-of-art powered legs.  Index Terms—rehabilitation robotics, actuator design, powered  prostheses, backdrivability.  I. INTRODUCTION  Use of conventional passive prostheses after lower-limb loss results in gait that is slower, less stable, and less energy efﬁ- cient than able-bodied locomotion [1], [2]. Passive prostheses aim to alleviate the effects of amputation using mechanisms such as springs, cams, and dampers to mimic normative gait patterns. However, passive prostheses are limited in function- ality due to the fact that such mechanisms can only dissipate energy that the user introduces. Although these passive devices restore some functionality, amputees are typically left with an asymmetric gait [3]. Moreover, most devices are designed for level-ground walking conditions and do not adequately","id":"d6e972e1-ad4f-48dc-811b-8016fbed8412"}

Gutierrez-Farewik  Abstract—Accurately predicting joint torque using wear- able sensors is crucial for designing assist-as-needed exoskeleton controllers to assist muscle-generated torque and ensure successful task performance. In this paper, we estimated ankle dorsiflexion\/plantarflexion, knee flex- ion\/extension, hip flexion\/extension, and hip abduc- tion\/adduction torques from electromyography (EMG) and kinematics during daily activities using neuromuscu- loskeletal (NMS) models and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The joint torque ground truth for model calibrating and training was obtained through inverse dynamics of captured motion data. A cluster approach that grouped movements based on characteristic simi- larity was implemented, and its ability to improve the estimation accuracy of both NMS and LSTM models was evaluated. We compared torque estimation accuracy of NMS and LSTM models in three cases: Pooled, Individual, and Clustered models. Pooled models used data from all 10 movements to calibrate or train one model, Individual models used data from each individual movement, and Clustered models used data from each cluster. Individual, Clustered and Pooled LSTM models all had relatively high joint torque estimation accuracy. Individual and Clustered NMS models had similarly good estimation performance whereas the Pooled model may be too generic to satisfy all movement patterns. While the cluster approach improved the estimation accuracy in NMS models in some move- ments, it made relatively little difference in the LSTM neural networks, which already had high estimation accuracy. Our study provides practical implications for designing assist- as-needed exoskeleton controllers by offering guidelines for selecting the appropriate model for different scenarios, and has potential to enhance the functionality of wearable exoskeletons and improve rehabilitation and assistance for individuals with motor disorders.

Collins1  Correspondence: gbryan@stanford.edu 1Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, USA Full list of author information is available at the end of the article  Abstract  Background: Load carriage is a typical activity in a wide range of professions, but prolonged load carriage is associated with increased fatigue and overuse injuries. Exoskeletons could improve the quality of life of these professionals by reducing metabolic cost to combat fatigue and reducing muscle activity to prevent injuries. Current exoskeletons have reduced the metabolic cost of loaded walking by up to 23% when assisting one or two joints. Greater metabolic reductions may be possible with optimized assistance of the entire leg.  Methods: We used human-in the-loop optimization to optimize hip-knee-ankle exoskeleton assistance with no additional load, a light load (15% of body weight), and a heavy load (30% of body weight) for three participants. All loads were applied through a weight vest with an attached waist belt. We measured metabolic cost, exoskeleton assistance, kinematics, and muscle activity. We performed one-tailed paired t-tests to determine signiﬁcant reductions for metabolic cost and muscle activity, and we performed an analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine signiﬁcant changes across load conditions for metabolic cost and applied power.  Results: Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking relative to walking in the device without assistance for all tested conditions. Exoskeleton assistance reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 47% with no load (p = 0.02), 35% with the light load (p = 0.03), and 43% with the heavy load (p = 0.02). The smaller metabolic reduction with the light load may be due to insuﬃcient participant training or lack of optimizer convergence. The total applied positive power was similar for all tested conditions, and the positive knee power decreased slightly as load increased. Optimized torque timing parameters were consistent across participants and load conditions while optimized magnitude parameters varied.","id":"55c10e03-19a8-4b12-a219-de6a7027daf2"}

Machine learning algorithms present an opportunity to develop methods for pre- dicting user’s locomotion mode. Currently, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) offers the standard solution in the state-of-the-art forsubjectdependentmodelsandhasbeenusedinthedevelopment of subject independent applications. However, the performance of subject independent models differ radically from their dependent counterpart. Furthermore, most of the studies limit the evaluation to a ﬁxed terrain with individual stair height and ramp inclination. In this study, we investigated the use of the XGBoost algorithm for developing a subject independent model across 8 individuals with transfemoral amputation. We evaluated the performance of XGBoost across different stair heights and inclination angles and found that it generalizes well across preset conditions. Our ﬁndings suggest that XGBoost offers a potential beneﬁt for both subject in- dependent and subject dependent algorithms outperforming LDA and NN (DEP SS Error: 2.93% ± 0.49%, DEP TS Error: 7.03% ± 0.74%, IND SS Error: 10.12% ± 3.16%, and IND TS Error: 15.78%±2.39%)(p<0.05).Wewerealsoabletoshowthatwiththe inclusionofextrasensorsthemodelperformance couldcontinually be improved in both user dependent and independent models (p < 0.05).

Gregg, Senior Member, IEEE  Abstract—Compared to rigid actuators, Series Elastic Ac- tuators (SEAs) offer a potential reduction of motor energy consumption and peak power, though these beneﬁts are highly dependent on the design of the torque-elongation proﬁle of the elastic element. In the case of linear springs, natural dynamics is a traditional method for this design, but it has two major limitations: arbitrary load trajectories are difﬁcult or impossible to analyze and it does not consider actuator constraints. Paramet- ric optimization is also a popular design method that addresses these limitations, but solutions are only optimal within the space of the parameters. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-parametric convex optimization program for the design of the nonlinear elastic element that minimizes energy consumption and peak power for an arbitrary periodic reference trajectory. To obtain convexity, we introduce a convex approximation to the expression of peak power; energy consumption is shown to be convex without approximation. The combination of peak power and energy consumption in the cost function leads to a multiobjective convex optimization framework that comprises the main contribution of this paper. As a case study, we recover the elongation-torque proﬁle of a cubic spring, given its natural oscillation as the reference load. We then design nonlinear SEAs for an ankle prosthesis that minimize energy consumption and peak power for different trajectories and extend the range of achievable tasks when subject to actuator constraints.

This study aimed to profile gait pathology in gait-impaired patients with MS using comprehensive 3D gait analysis and clinical walking tests. Thirty-seven patients with MS walked on the treadmill at their individual, sustainable speed while 20 healthy control subjects walked at all the different patient’s paces, allowing for comparisons independent of walking velocity. Kinematic analysis revealed pronounced restrictions in knee and ankle joint excursion, increased gait variability and asymmetry along with impaired dynamic stability in patients. The most discriminative single gait parameter, differentiating patients from controls with an accuracy of 83.3% (χ2 test; p = 0.0001), was reduced knee range of motion. Based on hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis, three principal pathological gait patterns were identified: a spastic-paretic, an ataxia-like, and an unstable gait. Follow-up assessments after 1 year indicated deterioration of walking function, particularly in patients with spastic-paretic gait patterns. Our findings suggest that impaired knee\/ankle control is common in patients with MS. Personalised gait profiles and clustering algorithms may be promising tools for stratifying patients and to inform patient- tailored exercise programs. Responsive, objective outcome measures are important for monitoring disease progression and treatment effects in MS trials.","id":"7fced4b7-b250-4abc-8c49-1e60d4ed0793"}

Shepherd, Student Member, IEEE, and Elliott J. Rouse, Member, IEEE  Abstract—Individuals with poststroke hemiparesis often exhibit mobility deﬁcits, particularly during tasks requiring high lower limb torques. The sit-to-stand transition is con- sistently marked by asymmetrical weight-bearing between the paretic and unaffected legs. One way to improve char- acteristics of stroke sit-to-stand may be to provide assis- tive knee extension torque with a powered exoskeleton. To perform research on the biomechanical effects of as- sisting sit-to-stand, a unilateral powered knee exoskeleton is required, which can accurately control torque. This pa- per introduces a novel series elastic actuator capable of producing the full torques and speeds required for sit-to- stand (80 Nm, 3 rad\/s). It utilizes a unique transmission conﬁguration with a series ﬁberglass beam spring that im- proves torque-control and reduces output impedance. The actuator is incorporated into a unilateral orthosis and a high-level sit-to-stand controller is implemented. A small validation study with three able-bodied subjects perform- ing sit-to-stand is presented, demonstrating the ability to appropriately provide assistance.  of the torque required for more normative sit-to-stand [5]. The knee may provide up to 70% of the mechanical work to com- plete the transition [6], so this deﬁcit leaves other joints or excessive pre-seat-off torso momentum to compensate. Knee strength is also a strong predictor of the ability to per- form independent sit-to-stand in more severely affected patients [7].  A knee exoskeleton providing extension assistance during sit-to-stand may be able to compensate for the missing knee torque and improve weight-bearing symmetry. To explore this concept, we plan to perform research with stroke subjects where assistivetorqueisprovidedbyakneeexoskeleton. Thisresearch is expected to determine the efﬁcacy of using such a device to improve sit-to-stand biomechanics. Additionally, it will provide speciﬁc design requirements, such as maximum torque, for fu- ture devices that may assist with sit-to-stand and other mobility tasks.

Despite recent technological and scientiﬁc achievements, more research is needed to realize the promise of intuitive, easy-to-wear, safe, and effective wearable robots. Directions of current technical innovation and future trends include the following.  1) Improved Sensing, Actuation, and Computation: New technologies are enabling better sensing and interpretation of human–robot interaction, new actuators are enabling better in- teraction, and enhanced computing power is enabling complex reasoning and control strategies. In particular, the emerging area of soft wearable robots has started to see exciting results from studies with various populations. There are now commercially available soft wearable rehabilitation robots for the lower and upper extremity of subjects who have suffered a stroke. In addi- tion, soft exosuits for the back help workers perform physically strenuous tasks in industry, alleviating injuries and providing a safer work environment.  2) Better Assessment: Currently, we lack standardized frameworks for evaluating the effectiveness of wearable robots, but this is beginning to change.

In order to improve the accuracy of regression prediction and reduce the training time, we proposed a regression prediction algorithm based on broad learning system (BLS) to predict the concentration of mixed gas. To further improve the accuracy of model predictions, we optimize the various parameters existing in the model to improve the performance of the model. Then, we change the initial random mapping weight assignment method of the model to further improve the data processing ability of the model, and the improved model is called GBLS. In the data processing experiment, we use the mixed gas of methane and ethylene as the test gas to test the GBLS model proposed in this article. We have compared GBLS with other existing methods including back propagation neural networks (BPNN), least squares support vector machines (LSSVM), extremely learning machine (ELM), linear regression (LR). Experimental results show that the proposed GBLS outperforms the other methods.  IndexTerms—Electronic nose, BLS, regression prediction, mixed gas.  I.

However, passive prosthetic knees are not able to provide high levels of resistance at the end of the sit-down movement when the knee is \u0000exed and users need the most support. Consequently, users are forced  to over-compensate with their upper body, residual hip, and intact leg, and\/or sit down with a ballistic and uncontrolled movement. Powered prostheses have the potential to solve this problem by controlling the joints using motors, which can produce higher levels of resistance at a larger range of joint positions than  passive damper systems. Therefore, powered prostheses have the potential to make sitting down more controlled and less di\u0000cult for above-knee amputees, improving their functional mobility.

Detection of IEDs is signiﬁ- cant for the diagnosis of epilepsy and the prediction of seizures. In this letter, we proposed a graph convolutional network and bi-directional LSTM co-embedded broad learning system to detect IEDS. Here, we represent EEG signal as a graph and utilize Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to extract contextual features. In addition, bi-directional LSTM is also adopted for extracting the temporal feature from signals. Then these features are incorpo- rated into Broad Learning System (BLS) to automatically detect epileptiform events.

Moreover, Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs) have been a biomarker for neurologists to diagnose epilepsy and predict seizures, which are the main target of clinical EEG interpretation [3]. It usually appears as sharp waves, spikes, or spike-wave-complexes in EEG [4]. Currently, the detection of IEDs is mainly done manually by neurologists. However, visual evaluation has various limitations, such as time-consuming reviews, interobserver variability, requirement of highly experienced and skilled neurologists [5], [6]. Hence, it is a necessary to develop an automated IEDs detection system. Some attempts have already been made to detect IEDs from scalp EEG signals, including morphology-based [7], [8], signal correlation-based [9], [10], feature engineering-based [11], and time-frequency decomposition-based [12], or the ensemble of multiple methods [13].

Unlike nearly all other proportional brakes, which operate in a normally unlocked mode, the brake presented here is designed such that it may be conﬁgured in either a normally unlocked or normally locked mode. The latter enables lower electrical energy consumption and added safety in the event of electrical power failure in certain applications. Following the de- vice description, experimental data are presented to characterize the performance of the brake.

Molinaro , Graduate Student Member, IEEE, Gayeon Choi, Jonathan Camargo , and Aaron J. Young , Member, IEEE  Abstract—Autonomous lower-limb exoskeletons must modulate assistance based on locomotion mode (e.g., to the corresponding to adapt ramp or stair ascent) changes in human biological joint dynamics. However, cur- rent mode classiﬁcation strategies for exoskeletons often require user-speciﬁc tuning, have a slow update rate, and rely on additional sensors outside of the exoskeleton sen- sor suite. In this study, we introduce a deep convolutional neural network-based locomotion mode classiﬁer for hip exoskeleton applications using an open-source gait biome- chanics dataset with various wearable sensors. Our ap- proach removed the limitations of previous systems as it is 1) subject-independent (i.e., no user-speciﬁc data), 2) ca- pable of continuously classifying for smooth and seamless mode transitions, and 3) only utilizes minimal wearable sen- sors native to a conventional hip exoskeleton. We optimized our model, based on several important factors contribut- ing to overall performance, such as transition label timing, model architecture, and sensor placement, which provides a holistic understanding of mode classiﬁer design. Our optimized DL model showed a 3.13% classiﬁcation error (steady-state: 0.80 ± 0.38% and transitional: 6.49 ± 1.42%), outperforming other machine learning-based benchmarks commonly practiced in the ﬁeld (p<0.05). Furthermore, our multi-modal analysis indicated that our model can main- tain high performance in different settings such as unseen slopes on stairs or ramps. Thus, our study presents a novel locomotion mode framework, capable of advancing robotic exoskeleton applications toward assisting community am- bulation.

Kuo  Abstract—Unilateral lower-limb amputees exhibit asymmetry in many gait features, such as ground force, step time, step length, and joint mechanics. Although these asymmetries result from weak prosthetic-side push-off, there is no proven mechanistic explanation of how that impairment propagates to the rest of the body. We used a simple dynamic walking model to explore possible consequences of a unilateral impairment similar to that of a transtibial amputee. The model compensates for reduced push-off work from one leg by performing more work elsewhere, for example during the middle of stance by either or both legs. The model predicts several gait abnormalities, including slower forward velocity of the body center-of-mass during intact-side stance, greater energy dissipation in the intact side, and more positive work overall. We tested these predictions with data from unilateral transtibial amputees (N = 11) and nonamputee control subjects (N = 10) walking on an instrumented treadmill. We ob- served several predicted asymmetries, including forward velocity during stance phases and energy dissipation from the two limbs, as well as greater work overall. Secondary adaptations, such as to reduce discomfort, may exacerbate asymmetry, but these simple principles suggest that some asymmetry may be unavoidable in cases of unilateral limb loss.

A mechanistic study of the fundamental effects of unilateral limb loss and strategies for compensating for this loss might yield insights regarding asymmetric gait.","id":"ac58087e-881f-4a05-bcfb-732cb4ff14f5"}

We evaluated the performance of XGBoost across different stair heights and inclination angles and found that it generalizes well across preset conditions.

Previous research studies on human-robot interaction and biomechanics have largely been performed with rigid exoskeletons that add significant lower extremities and provide constraints to the wearer’s natural kinematics in both actuated and non-actuated degrees of freedom. Actuated lightweight soft exosuits minimize these effects and provide a unique opportunity to study human-robot interaction in wearable systems without affecting the subjects underlying natural dynamics. In this paper, we present the design and control of a reconfigurable multi-joint actuation platform that can provide biologically realistic torques to ankle, knee, and hip joints through lower extremity soft exosuits. Two different soft exosuits have been designed to deliver assistive forces through Bowden cable transmission to the ankle and hip joints. Through human subject experiments, it is demonstrated that with a real- time admittance controller, accurate force profile tracking can be achieved during walking. The average energy delivered to the test subject was calculated while walking at 1.25 m\/s and actuated with 15% of the total torque required by the biological joints. The results show that the ankle joint received an average of 3.02J during plantar flexion and that the hip joint received 1.67J during flexion each gait cycle. The efficiency of the described suit and controller in transferring energy to the human biological joints is 70% for the ankle and 48% for the hip.  inertia to the  couple the body with the exoskeletons. Due to the rigid linkages, joints misalignments, the traditional rigid exoskeletons constrain the biological joints of the actuated and non-actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs), which leads to deviation from the wearer’s natural motion, discomfort or injuries[15, 16]. Moreover, an additional consequence is that a wearer will typically expend an increased amount of energy to complete a desired motion (e.g. walking).

Gregg, and Maani Ghaffari  Abstract—Powered prosthetic legs must anticipate the user’s intent when switching between different locomotion modes (e.g., level walking, stair ascent\/descent, ramp ascent\/descent). Numerous data-driven classiﬁcation techniques have demon- strated promising results for predicting user intent, but the performance of these intent prediction models on novel subjects remains undesirable. In other domains (e.g., image classiﬁca- tion), transfer learning has improved classiﬁcation accuracy by using previously learned features from a large dataset (i.e., pre-trained models) and then transferring this learned model to a new task where a smaller dataset is available. In this paper, we develop a deep convolutional neural network with intra-subject (subject-dependent) and inter-subject (subject- independent) validations based on a human locomotion dataset. We then apply transfer learning for the subject-independent model using a small portion (10%) of the data from the left-out subject. We compare the performance of these three models. Our results indicate that the transfer learning (TL) model outperforms the subject-independent (IND) model and is comparable to the subject-dependent (DEP) model (DEP Error: 0.74 ± 0.002%, IND Error: 11.59 ± 0.076%, TL Error: 3.57 ± 0.02% with 10% data). Moreover, as expected, transfer learning accuracy increases with the availability of more data from the left-out subject. We also evaluate the performance of the intent prediction system in various sensor conﬁgurations that may be available in a prosthetic leg application. Our results suggest that a thigh IMU on the the prosthesis is sufﬁcient to predict locomotion intent in practice.  I. INTRODUCTION","id":"013e5894-1aac-4718-9090-a814afde4a7d"}

Miller1*  , Guan Rong Tan1, Emily M. Farina2, Alison L. Sheets‑Singer2 and Steven H. Collins1  Abstract Background: Reducing the energy cost of running with exoskeletons could improve enjoyment, reduce fatigue, and encourage participation among novice and ageing runners. Previously, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators with offboard motors were used to greatly reduce the energy cost of running with powered ankle plantarflexion assis‑ tance. Through a process known as “human‑in‑the‑loop optimization”, the timing and magnitude of assistance torque was optimized to maximally reduce metabolic cost. However, to achieve the maximum net benefit in energy cost outside of the laboratory environment, it is also necessary to consider the tradeoff between the magnitude of device assistance and the metabolic penalty of carrying a heavier, more powerful exoskeleton.  Methods: In this study, tethered ankle exoskeleton emulators were used to characterize the effect of peak assistance torque on metabolic cost during running. Three recreational runners participated in human‑in‑the‑loop optimization at four fixed peak assistance torque levels to obtain their energetically optimal assistance timing parameters at each level.  Results: We found that the relationship between metabolic rate and peak assistance torque was nearly linear but with diminishing returns at higher torque magnitudes, which is well‑approximated by an asymptotic exponential function. At the highest assistance torque magnitude of 0.8 Nm\/kg, participants’ net metabolic rate was 24.8 (p allowed during stance (80% of stance) and optimized timing of torque removal was at toe‑off (100% of stance); similar assistance timing was preferred across participants and torque magnitudes.  2.3% 4e–6) lower than running in the unpowered devices. Optimized timing of peak assistance torque was as late as  =  ±  Conclusions: These results allow exoskeleton designers to predict the energy cost savings for candidate devices with different assistance torque capabilities, thus informing the design of portable ankle exoskeletons that maximize net metabolic benefit.

This controller is based on the time delayed, self-feedback known for stabilizing oscillatory systems under certain conditions. In this controller, there are no separate estimators for the gait phase nor the environment, yet the controller can be generalized to operateundervariouswalkingconditions(e.g.,stairandrampwalking).We ﬁrst deﬁne a state variable representing the current leg’s movement with hip joint angles. A simple assistance control can be described in closed- loop form with the delayed state feedback. By assigning the appropriate time-delay and self-feedback gain, we can generate assistive torques sta- bly under the interaction between human and exoskeleton. The controller provides immediate and smooth assistance to user movement by reﬂecting the change of leg motion at every control period. The proposed joint-angle- based delayed-feedback assistance controller can operate under various walking speeds and environmental changes (e.g., stairs and ramps) without the need for additional sensors, computational processing, and parameter adjustment. Using a simple leg swing model, we perform a stability anal- ysis under a simpliﬁed condition to provide insights into the effects of the time-delayed feedback in oscillatory systems. Then, we experimentally val- idate the efﬁcacy of the proposed assistance controller by measuring the metabolic energy expenditure for level treadmill walking.

Herrin ,  Abstract—Genu recurvatum, or knee hyperextension, is a complex gait pattern with a variety of etiologies, and is often connected with knee weakness, lack of motor control, and spasticity. Because of the atypical forces placed on the soft tissues, early treatment or prevention of knee hyperex- tension may help prevent further degradation of the knee joint. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of a knee exoskeleton to mitigate hyperextension and increase swing range of motion in ﬁve children\/adolescents who presented with unilateral genu recurvatum. Over the course of three visits, each participant practiced walking with the exoskele- ton, which provided torque assistance during both stance and swing based on an impedance control law. In ﬁnal vali- dation trials, the exoskeleton was effective in reducing knee hyperextension (0.2 ± 4.7° average peak knee extension without exo to 9.9 ± 10.3° with exo) and improving swing range of motion by 14.0 ± 4.5° increase on average. How- ever, while the exoskeleton was effective in normalizing the kinematics, it did not lead to improved spatio-temporal asymmetry measures. This work showcases a promising potential application of a robotic knee exoskeleton for im- proving the kinematic characteristics of genu recurvatum gait.

Thirty elderly adults (15 males\/ 15 females) participated in thispaper. The experimental pro- tocol consisted of overground gait at comfortable speed under three different conditions: free gait without robot assistance, robot-assisted gait with zero torque (RAG-Z), and full RAG. Under all conditions, muscle effort was analyzed using a 12-channel surface electromyography system. Spatio-temporal data were collected at 120 Hz using a 3-D motion capture system with six infrared cam- eras. Metabolic cost parameters were collected as oxygen consumptionperunit(ml\/min\/kg)andaerobicenergyexpen- diture (Kcal\/min). In the RAG condition,participantsdemon- stratedimprovedgaitfunction,decreasedmuscleeffort,and reduced metabolic cost. Although the hip assist robot only provides assistance at the hip joint, our results demon- strated a clear reduction in knee and ankle muscle activity in addition to decreased hip ﬂexor and extensor activity. Our ﬁndings suggest that this robot has the potential to improve stabilization of the trunk during walking in elderly adults.
